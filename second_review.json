I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!    Travis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there!   Next Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days!   Travis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!","time_created":"2017-01-14 "}

Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn't even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn't stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won't be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman's behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don't make your guest feel unwelcome because you can't do you job properly.","time_created":"2018-01-30 "}

Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, \" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?\" She does.   My hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard \"mmmm this is so good\" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.  So-  Do order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels.   If they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny.   Do make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a time_created unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.

The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red time_created in it. Fancy!  A simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side.   I also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it!   I'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled.

The \"Man O'War\" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA.  The only big miss on their beers I've had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.   Nonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn't had from them would be top notch... and they are!  The reason for the 2 rating should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well!  The servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there!  After another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head.  This is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn't seem very pleased when leaving.  The toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.","time_created":"2015-01-18 "}

What can go wrong? A couple of things. First things first, this place is more of a \"rice bowl\" kind of place. I thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes, but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats. The ordering was a little confusing at first, but one of the employees helped us out and I got the 2-item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all rice(jerk). I also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side.  I'm gonna admit, this place looks kinda dirty. I don't think Arizona uses those health department letter grade system like California does, but if I were to just judge by how it looked inside, i'd give it a \"C\" grade lol. We waited for about 15 minutes or so and finally got our food. We took it to go and ate at our hotel room.   Mmmm... the food was just alright. The jade chicken was nothing special. It tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chicken\/sesame chicken variant. The hengrenade chicken, although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken, was still pretty spicy for me. Just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy. If you aren't sure, ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering, but it was way too spicy for me.   The jade chicken quesadilla was decent, but nothing special. Just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese. A friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of Mcdonald's apple pie. If you order the burrito, be warned that it's a burrito for gnomes and smurfs, but he said it was tasty.   They provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent, again nothing special.   Not gonna lie, the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside. I used the bathroom like 5 times.

Watch the game somewhere else.....  To those unfamiliar with The Big Game experience at WestGate you typically would get in line to watch the Superbowl in the theater portion of the hotel around 8 am on Superbowl Sunday. This line can get extremely long yet the earlier you get in line your choice of seating significantly improves.So...after waiting in line for a few hours we were notified the lower portion of the theater was reserved for paid customers who previously purchased wristbands for $100 (including alcohol and hot dogs) and instead we would be seated in the balcony portion of the theater.No problem, something different, we said. Mistake.  So at 1:30 pm we were sent upstairs to the balcony to take our seats and prepare to watch the big game at 3:30. Once we take our seats one of us ( we're in a group of 8 ) will hold the seats while the rest of us will go out to the casino floor and gamble or go the the sports book and place a couple last minute bets.Please note the patrons that leave the auditorium will receive a hand stamp or wristband to allow reentry to the theater. BUT INSTEAD....  We were told by Westgate staff that no hand stamps or wristbands would be given and we were ON OUR OWN if we choose to leave and we would not be allowed back in. Wow. That's right, after waiting in line all morning if we wanted to go downstairs to play blackjack, place a bet at the book, or maybe have a bite to eat because no food was made available upstairs we would be out of luck. Nice work Westgate.  So we were seated upstairs...stuck. With no food or soda available for purchase. Only beer and water was sold in the balcony food counter. That was at 1:45 p.m. After vigorously complaining to Westgate staff ( to ushers with yellow jackets and security with black jackets ) at 3:04 pm wristbands were given out. At 3:18 hot dogs and soda were made available for sale in the balcony. I believe this was a direct result of all the upset patrons like myself that were seated in the balcony level.  In summary, for being the biggest sportbook in Las Vegas this place is dysfunction and fails to satisfy the most basic request to provide food and comfort to betting patrons. A total mess. This place sucks. Watch the big game and bet your money some where else. We will.","time_created":"2017-02-09 "}

When I went in, they were almost twice what I usually pay to begin with.  Then, before starting the pedicure, I specifically told them I already had gel polish on my toes.  They didn't tell me right then and there \"that will be an extra $5'.  No, they waited until it was time to pay, and not only charged me for that, but they charged me all kinds of extra fees that I didn't even ask for!  I had also informed the girl that my toenail was loose and needed gluing.  While I was looking at my phone, all of a sudden I felt this sensation, and she RIPPED OFF MY TOENAIL!!!!  Without even asking me!!!!!!  So then she had another girl come and put acrylic on there since the nail underneath was only 1\/2 grown.  Again, they didn't tell me how much this would be, or even ask my permission, they just charged me at the end.    The added stone 'massage' was barely a massage!  She rubbed the stones up my lower legs a couple times, and that was it.  It lasted about 30 seconds.   And when I asked for a design, I'm used to getting a board with a bunch of designs to choose from.  She didn't even ask me what I wanted, she just painted a few lines on my two toes and then charge me 5 MORE dollars for that!   Ugh, I don't care HOW ugly my toes look next time, I will NEVER go anywhere else besides Bella Nails again, they ROCK!!!!!!!  This place was appalling.

Once we were all seated, we were not greeted by anyone for over half an hour, and when someone did come by, we asked whether we could place our orders, to which he said he could not; he's doing something else - so we waited at least another 15 minutes before someone came to finally take our orders.   MAIN: Caprese Salad  The salad was okay - a bit salty for my liking. I personally did not find this dish filling, so I ordered the sweet potato fries as well (See below).  MAIN: Sweet Potato Fries (this was worth it)   These fries were actually very delicious - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

When the I had taken my car to the other Discount Tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles I have on my car. When he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280. Which I had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price.

This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious.   I actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey\/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been uptime_createdd in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood\/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.  Ok onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.  The portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.)   I bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 rating then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality.   The specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead.   All in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor.","time_created":"2014-10-27 "}

The frozen yogurt seems less rich in Piccadilly's and the flavors are not as strong.  The price per ounce is also marginally higher at Piccadilly's.  There are definitely pluses to Piccadilly's yogurt though.  I liked the toppings better - I thought the mochi tasted better, the brownie pieces were bigger, and the chocolate caramel turtles went great on ice cream.  The chocolate caramel turtles should be a standard topping for both frozen yogurt and ice cream places.

Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.  Too bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for.   The playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings!   After a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the \"nice stuff\" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, \"Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?\" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.  After carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff.   So, yeah, im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime. (You think?). Lol. Maybe as a duck.","time_created":"2013-05-28 "}

I always like to chose a signature burger so I opted for the Spicy Cajun Burger and combo'd it up with there Beer Battered Rings and a Jones Strawberry-Lime  Soda.  Its a small location with an even smaller patio ( maybe 8 bar stools on a cramped balcony) that looks onto Charles Street. But definitely sit outside if you can grab a seat. Luckily the patio was vacant that late afternoon.  Toppings - They Spicy Cajun Burger - Avocado, jalapeños, lettuce, Jalapeño havarti, tomatoes, Cajun spice & Smokey chipotle & honey mayo. There was ample toppings on the burger, I enjoyed the avocado on my burger, overall not too spicy but good kick from the sliced jalapeños.  Meat - Grilled perfectly, tasted average, but I found it too small compared to the bun.  Bun - Very soft, tasted good, but didn't hold up against the burger and all the toppings and at the end I was left with lots of bun and no more burger.  Beer Battered Onion Rings - Very thick batter on these rings, golden brown, crunchy, very filling.  Drink -Jones Strawberry-Lime Soda - Yummy not sour but good balance,  Overall prompt friendly service, quaint little patio, average burger but good for a quick fix in satisfying the burger craving.","time_created":"2011-09-25 "}

All the other places treated it as a marketing event and brought coupons.   Get the idea? It's all good at this neighborhood gem!","time_created":"2011-01-09 "}

However, our group was quite disappointed with this restaurant. Granted, we were expecting a lot from an Italian restaurant in the Venetian, but I also think those are fine expectations to have when eating at these prices.  First, we changed our reservation, and they said they could accommotime_created the time. Clearly, they shouldn't have. We were seated at a folding table in the hallway next to the restaurant, quite literally in the food court next to a kiosk selling trinkets to tourists. Whatever ambiance this restaurant might offer is a mystery to me. They shouldn't have switched the reservation if it wasn't possible to accommotime_created the change (our fault, wouldn't blame them). I know they threw a table together as our table and chairs looked different from the rest of the ones set up. A few were just in front of the restaurant but not off to the side like ours was.  I expected to pay a lot in the Venetian, but I expected to be blown away. I would have preferred dining at several places we walked at on the way to this one. I paid $17 for spaghetti carbonara. It was very tasty, a well-balanced sauce with a decent amount of pancetta. However, I finished the whole thing. I can't finish an entree at Olive Garden for the same price. I also ate a few pieces of bread. One of my friends ordered a chicken kabob (who knows why that's sold at an Italian restaurant). It was one single kabob with perhaps 4-5 pieces of chicken and 4-5 vegetables on a bed of rice and it cost $25! Absolutely outrageous.   To top it off, we told the waiter we were celebrating a birthday. He said ok, so I expected we would receive a dessert, as is customary. We received nothing. Of course, our waiter didn't seem keen on giving us the time of day so I don't know why I expected him to remember a birthday.","time_created":"2017-01-02 "}

I love going to Seventh Street market, sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure.  I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market, and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.  If one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.  I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta.  It was pretty expensive at $2\/topping = $20 med pizza. But it was delicious.  The arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for. I crave that dressing days later. So light and fresh but flavorful.","time_created":"2014-07-13 "}

We, my boyfriend and I,  saw their ad on their website for an $$85 per couple Valentine's Day Dinner.  We had reservations for 6p.m. this reservation was made on Friday, we dined on Saturday. When we arrived right at 6p.m. there were plenty of OPEN tables in the restaurant.  When the hostess looked for our name on the reservation list it showed we were to be sat at table 14.  The list said in large print at the top..DO NOT CHANGE TABLES.  The hostess walked us past 8 - 10 2 person tables to sit us at a 2 person table literally 6inches from the neighboring table!  Could we have asked to sit elsewhere? Apparently not as the hostess was under direct orders not to change tables.  Could we have dined elsewhere...probably not considering it is Valentines Weekend and we drove 3 hours to get there and have no reservations any where else, and no idea at 6p.m. where to go.    So we sat.  We could hear EVERY WORD the table next to us said. (Which by the way when you take your pregnant wife out for Valentine's Day you probably shouldn't answer the phone when your buddies call or talk about how \"hot\" her female coworker is.)  This was so awkward, you had to watch every word you said to be sure the neighboring diners weren't eavesdropping on personal info. Most uncomfortable \"romantic\" evening of my life...  Now to the food.  The Valentine's Day meal was a choice of appetizer to share (except for one - they sold out the night before), a \"salad\", choice of any appetizer on the menu (again except for the New Zealand Rack of Lamb, because it too sold out the night before.), a Chocolate Creme Brulet to share for dessert, and a bottle of Nero D'Avola (which we were told is a $35 bottle of wine). We ordered two bowls of soup to go along with the special.   The soup - Lobster Bisque (Delicious) and Minestrone with sausage ( missing the sausage and the vegetable were literally giant sized. It was like eating a salad with broth and rice in it). However it did taste quite nice.  The appetizer - Artichokes with Prosciutto.. YUMMO!  The salad - hmm not what I had in mind. A tiny plate of Feta Cheese, cucumber, pear in balsamic vinegar and gosh knows what else...but NOT a traditional salad..So beware!  Taste was great, but if you are expecting a bowl of leafy greens and some toppings...This it is not.  The meal - Veal with shrimp and gnocchi..Quite pleasing to the palette.  The dessert - Chocolate Creme Brulet...   Umm not so much..it was quite clearly 3\/4 cup of Chocolate Mousse with a sliced strawberry on top and a store bought sugar cookie in the shape of a heart.  Yes it did taste good, however...where was the Creme Brulet the waiter raved about?  The wine - Nero D'Avola...yes I am a red wine drinker, the wine was delicious.  But upon looking it up when we returned to the hotel room...found it only sold for $10 - $13 a bottle...Why the lie? We would have ordered the special anyway...  The atmosphere...beautiful, romantic (if you like sharing intimate moments with strangers) but it was pleasantly dark with candles and Christmas lights through out. They had an electric fireplace when we first sat down we observed and enjoyed the heat coming from it, since as you know we dress up, not dress warm when going out to dinner. The place lost half of its power 5 minutes after sitting down. The manager  chose to turn the fireplace off, even though it stayed lit and running during the power outage.  By the time I left, my toes were frozen.  We finished eating and paid for the bill at 7:50p.m. I turned around and noticed FOUR empty 2 person tables. They had never been sat, but we had to sit with an unfamiliar couple!   Upon leaving the hostess who was so sweet and friendly upon arrival was short and sarcastic in her good bye and have a nice evening.  Would I go back when in town again? No.  At the risk of being sat in that situation again.  The food can be the most delicious in the world, but I still prefer and deserve privacy when dining.  And to the lady we sat next to...Good luck on your birth, maybe your dislike for cheese will go away after you give birth.","time_created":"2011-02-13 "}

We both ordered all you can eat crab legs and they were fresh, hot and delicious. I do feel the sticker price was high but we must have had 5 buckets each so it equates to 10 bucks a pound.   The only negative I did feel could be addressed is the tables are made of some type of epoxy resin so being outside, May be melting or something because there was a sticky residue on the table top.

The Toronto store was quick to identify the style number of the ring but said they no longer had stock and couldn't help me, I asked them if they could check other locations with no avail.    Because the ring had a lot of sentimental value I decided to call the  Hong Kong location where the ring was purchased. Over the phone the clerk, Jane, and amazing representative knew the ring as well and again it was out of stock but she offered to check with head office in to see if any exist  at any location world wide.  She called me the next day from Hong Kong to inform me she found the last ring in London and it was now in transit to her store where she would hold it for me until I return to Hong Kong in a few months.  Not wanting to risk the ring getting sold or lost, I paid for it with my credit card over the phone and arranged for a friend to pick it up and send it by courier.  The ring now sits on my finger never to be removed again :)...  This is the type of service that builds loyalty.    The Montblanc store in Hong Kong is located in Pacific Mall. Jane has since been promoted and transferred to their flagship store on Kowloon Side on Canton Road. I'm not surprised of her promotion given the service she provided me.  I will be forever be loyal to the Hong Kong location. Thanks Jane!  I'm giving 2 rating to the Toronto location, the Hong Kong location would easily have 5 rating.","time_created":"2014-04-19 "}

My husband asked to sit at another table but the hostess said \"No\" so we had the baby between our table and the customers next to us, luckily she's a great baby!! The table and booth were dirty and floor was sticky, gross, and I had to kick a fork out from under my seat. The service was subpar but the waiter was nice. It took 20 mins for my boys to get their drinks and refills, well they were sparse to say the least. I ordered steamed broccoli which was actually raw when it came out the first time but they, what I believe, microwaved it to warm it up. My poor daughter in law had a charcoal patty which she sent back and it took a good 25-30 mins to be replaced. The worse part is my son has a sensitivity to gluten so he ordered a gluten free bun but they gave him a Ciabatta bun which he didn't realize until he had already eaten half the burger. My husband brought the issues up to the manager but she didn't really contribute anything to the situation other than sending the burnt burger back. The waiter's solution for the inconvenience was a free appetizer card to be redeemed the next time they came in.

The value for money clearly isn't fair considering they are dishes tapas style. In a regular restaurant you'd get real size dishes for the price you pay for tapas there.  2 mini starters, 2 entrees (tapas style) shared + 1 desert with one glass of wine gave us a $90 bill and we left without feeling full. The desert was a caramel fondant with pear ice cream, probably the only thing we ate that was so incredible we would have paid twice the price for. Otherwise it was too pricy.

A couple of the therapists are good, and some lack experience. As a stocking stuffer for my husband, I scheduled an appointment for him to meet with Roberta, a very capable therapist. When he arrived for his appointment, his name did not show on the schedule. Yet the gentleman working the front desk clearly remembered scheduling that appointment with me. He blamed it on glitchy new scheduling software. I was extremely disappointed and embarrassed, since it was a gift. But what else could we do but reschedule? An appointment was set, again with Roberta, through the same desk attendant, for this afternoon. When my husband arrived this afternoon, he was placed with a different therapist, who confessed that she did not know how to work with his specific shoulder issue. So he again rescheduled. This is getting ridiculous, and I'm considering canceling my membership over it.","time_created":"2016-01-04 "}

It's definitely not for everyone - there is a price tag attached. But if you shop at places like Holt Renfrew or even the Bay then this place is considerably better in my opinion.  The reason - the sales agents are just better. They have pretty good sales twice a year, which is when I tend to go but sizing is obviously an issue at those times. I appreciate that they carry various price points in the mid to high range.    Overall, I wouldn't get my formal wear from here. That's just me personally. I'd rather go to the U.S. and pay half the price for the same quality. But if you can't do that, they have an excellent selection and great tailors. You can find cheaper tailors in Toronto, but at least at GotStyle you don't have to go through the hassle of finding the right tailer. You can trust the store.   They have an excellent selection of casual clothing and interesting and cool clothing pieces too.  This is definitely a go to place if you're anything like me and don't know how to buy jeans. My last visit at the store, Jannette spent a great deal of time educating my friend and I on how to dress. We left the store uncharacteristically self aware of ourselves, but really, we learnt a great deal in the process.","time_created":"2013-01-27 "}

My service has been absolutely horrible every time except for once when a girl named Jess waited on us. The rest of the waitresses are completely incompetent and utterly rude off the bat.   When we began ordering appetizers the waitress stopped us and asked if this was \"going to be complicated or not.\" She then forgot to put in an order for 1 of 3 appetizers ordered. It took about 15 mins after getting 2 of them, to even bring that to her attention, for which she didn't even apologize. After 35mins and someone else bringing our food out, we finally had to go to the bar and ask someone to come take our drink orders, a task that was also messed up (I ordered their special of Big ass margeritas to which I received a small mason jar of mostly ice). They told me it'd be free, but it honestly wasn't even worth that. After that, the only time I saw our waitress was when she was visibly talking about us and pointing with another waitress. Completely unprofessional. A different waitress had to bring us our checks and messed that up too.   I had this same waitress the Tuesday before accompanied by the same crummy service. That's when I realized that it wasn't just a bad or busy night (it was a Tuesday for crying out loud), but that this woman is just REALLY bad at customer service.

Our party was big so we were seated outside on the patio which was enclosed and heated.  The menu changes a lot apparently and there is also a pretty big specials menu. For apps we got oysters, a sea urchin (from the specials menu), the foie gras terrine (from the specials menu), and the veal tartare. Everything was incredible and pairings were perfect. For example the bread that came with the foie gras was completely different than the toast served with the veal tartare which was completely different than the bread we were served with butter and pickles while we were waiting for our starters.  For dinner everyone got the lobster spaghetti. The portion was way big enough for two after apps and it was incredibly rich between the sauce, bacon and huge lobster chunks. Each order of the pasta comes with half a lobster.  Every wine pairing we tried was amazing.  Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but the meal was definitely above out expectations.

(You are old like me if you know that theme song!)  Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.  Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.  Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!  Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.    So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.    The food:  Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.  Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.  Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.    Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.    Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.  Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.  Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.  Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!  TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.  2 rating bumped to 3 because the service was good.  The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!","time_created":"2016-07-03 "}

The food is incredible and you can tell the people that run it are super-appreciative of everyone that comes through the door. They are very proud of their food and they make sure to tell you it's all made in house - i.e. no cans of anything. The lady that served us must have significant influence on the food as she told me she is from Mexico City so a lot of the food made is from the city's influence. I told her I was visiting MC in January and she encouraged me to try some enchiladas down there to prove the similarities.  The enchiladas I had were unlike any I've ever had. Perhaps this is how they are supposed to be? The chicken was not wrapped in a tortilla. The two tortillas were sautéed in green chiles, folded over and laid at the bottom of the dish. It was then topped with lettuce, chicken, crema and all the other good stuff. It was the best I've ever had. I mean it.  Warning: When the dish indicates it's spicy, it's spicy. Those were the spiciest enchiladas I've ever had, but I appreciate the spice. My gf, however, was fortunate in her decision to get the carnitas because she would have not been able to handle the enchiladas.   By the way, the carnitas were excellent, as well.

I really want to be a fan of this place though. The red salsa is good and hot while the green satisfies the less adventurous.  The guacamole (made to your specs at the table) is delicious and its pretty much all my 4 year old eats there.  I normally get the tacos, either brisket or fish and they're really great, though I'm not a fan of mango salsas in general.   Last night we had the guac and a couple of Wednesday special margaritas which were just right.  We thought the chips tasted a little stale though and the small bowl, coupled with distracted waitstaff, became empty quickly. My wife and I split the main dish, which was a special \"baked brisket enchilada\" recommended by the waitress.  It was huge and definitely more than enough for too, but we didn't care for it. There didn't seem to be much beef in it; it was mostly sauce and cheese.  It will be awhile before we go again, and I think we'll stick to the tacos when we do. In summary, lots to like here, but I'd say stick to the basics.","time_created":"2011-07-28 "}

It didn't even fill you up for that kind of money! The soup comes in a small container and the sub is very small for being a half. Very disappointed in how much came on the sub. They make them with their back to you and you can not see the items they put on and they don't even ask what you want on it. They just proceed to make it the way they want. I can honestly say you get so much more for your money at Subway for much less and you can make the sub the way you want and you get very full and sometimes even have leftovers!

The steak burrito was really good because of the chimicurri sauce which had a refreshing and light taste. The shrimp burrito that came with the platter wasn't as good as it was heavier on the rice and beans so it didn't feel like it had enough shrimp but the taco made up for it. The drinks they have are different and refreshing too, I had a pomegranate lemonade by odowalla that uses real sugar instead of corn sryup.

The lady didn't tell me a price in the drive through which is annoying because they don't have a screen that tells you. She asked if I wanted a bean and cheese burrito. Well obviously I said yes I want cheese in it. The price on the menu said it was like $2.50. There was no mention of cheese in my burrito costing more. So I pull up to the window and she tells me it will be $9.40 or whatever. I said, I'm sorry how much?? So I'm sitting there doing my own math and it still didn't add up. $2.09 for a drink, $2 something for the taco and $2 something for the burrito. Even with tax there was absolutely no way that it would have added up to that much. So I get the receipt and they charged me $4.58 for a burrito!! There sign said $2 something. I pulled around and went in and their price inside said $3 something for the burrito. I went up and asked why I was overcharged $4.58 for a burrito. He said because I got cheese in it. I said, your burritos don't come with cheese in them??? They always have and I've never been charged extra for it!! What place doesn't put cheese in a burrito?? Also, for the first time their taco was bad. I opened the box and the taco shell was wet and soggy!! Usually it's nice and crispy\/crunchy and this time was not. I told them their signs are wrong. Also that it's ridiculous you charge that much for a burrito with cheese!! Told them I will never be back!! I can get better food at Taco Bell and more food for the same price!!

There is a reason that you have to get your own furniture items and load your own cars\/trucks\/vans with your purchases...to save the costs of Ikea!

The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going.   Last time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.  I paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything.   When we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin.   I walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"I'll be right with you.\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say \"Wow, you are really something else.\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me.   I honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction\/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.  I realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere.","time_created":"2014-01-17 "}

My X3 lasted me 10 years and although there were a few hiccups, I can still say that car was pretty darn reliable and I got my money's worth. But sometimes, you just have to let go and find a replacement.  I did my research and considered getting a Mini, Fiat or a Lexus. My loyalty is with BMW. I locked in on a particular car and off to the dealer I went. We were walking around the lot looking at other models and colors when a car salesman saw us and helped me get my car. My sister kept throwing her ideas and opinions as to what car I should get. I told David (sales advisor) what features I need and we ended up with the first car I was looking at.  Then, the dreaded test driving the car. I'm not a big fan of driving a car that isn't mine...or driving, period! I think convincing me to test drive took the most time and David told me to just drive around the lot but that was a trick! There was a part of the lot that's blocked off by a semi and the only way around it is to get on the road. My sister was a backseat driver as if I needed to be more anxious but David kept me calm. He's so funny. We made it back to the dealership in one piece.  I signed my papers and wrote my check but it was gym time so, we told David we'd come back for the car after the gym since they still had to detail it anyway. It was the most entertaining car-buying experience ever. We were all laughing and chatting about cars, the gym, nutrition, Hello Kitty, Yoda, etc. David explained and showed me what my car can do and at the end he said, \"I wish all my clients are as fun as you.\"  I get follow-up phone calls and e-mails and if I have any questions about my car, David responds quickly.

Let me explain...  There are not many \"old\" restaurants in this town. We don't seem to value\/frequent\/patronize places that have been around putting out food for a long time. I think we should. Even when the food isn't show stopping. Why? This place has tremendous character and charm. There's an \"Old Western Vegas\" feel to Bob Taylor's. Established in 1955, it's the oldest restaurant in Las Vegas. Its a throwback to a rugged, carnivorous cowboy culture that has existed in this town for decades. And still exists. I did appreciate the slice of Vegas kitch that Bob Taylor's offers.   FOOD ISSUES: So with all that charm how could this place go wrong? This place could be great. It really should be great. But they are not putting enough care into the food. I ordered the rib eye and asked for it to be medium rare. I was worried about it being overcooked and figured if a mistake was made, I'd be in the medium range. My instincts were correct. But the steak was closer to well done. In total, three steaks at our table were seriously overcooked. In a steakhouse. With a man tasked with grilling the steaks. Sigh. The fourth steak, smoked prime rib, was cooked properly. But the prime rib is cooked ahead if time, right? How was I prepared for this overcooked piece of meat? How did this only occasional red-meat-eater suspect that my steak would not be treated with attentive care?   I'll tell you. When we walked in there was a large grill at the front of the restaurant with a number if steaks cooking on it. But the chef was not watching the meat. He wasn't even in front of the grill. He was nowhere to be seen as we walked through the doors. And there were at least 4 steaks cooking when we arrived. So I figured that my steak would receive the same lack of attention.    I ordered a simple naked potato and a side salad to accompany my steak. Both were fine. But there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg, is there? People rave about the garlic bread and I think it's because the rest of the meal is so mediocre, that the cheesy bread becomes the highlight if the meal. It was just OK. The most inexperienced cook could make it at home with sourdough, butter, and three types of cheese.   A few people in our party ordered the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good. After tasting it, I was grateful to have passed on this wet, mush.   SERVICE: Our waitress was very attentive and responsive. She was more than willing to return the overcooked steaks.   I won't be back, but I'm glad to have visited this historic spot.  Service: 4 rating  Kitch: 4 rating  Food: 1 star","time_created":"2013-06-24 "}

The first time I went there I had my car detailed for $150 after discounts. The detail had been a little rushed because the location was extra busy that day and they were also short staffed. As a result there appeared to be some minor scratching. Jared was immediately on the ball and worked to have the scratched buffed out and fixed. I was very impressed with him as I watched and saw him masterfully handle other customer issues like mine. I was impressed enough that I told the man to his face that I was going to be a loyal customer directly as a result of his good work.  I am not good with names or time_createds, but I remember this man's name, because he does his job with pride. After Jared, I became a fastpass customer and still remain one.  COBBLESTONE, PAY CLOSE ATTENTION! THIS IS THE KIND OF EMPLOYEE YOU NEED MORE OF!  Now the Bad: 7700 S Autoplex  I first went to this location because I needed an oil change and the 616 location does not do oil changes. I got a heavy up-sale routine but went with it anyway. I also got a wash that was far below the standards of the 616 location. I let that all slide, as just being an off day.  I then went a second time for a wash, also below standard. I also let that slide.  I then went to get a wash yesterday. Not only was the wash worse than ever, but the car interior looked worse coming out than it did before I came! To begin with the carpets were barely vacuumed at all. There was dust and small dirt everywhere never even attempted to be cleaned. The only real evidence that they did anything was white stuff rubbed into the grain of dash around the driver's side air conditioning vent. There were also several new white smudges on the back of the seats as well as the seat back and headrests of both sides of the back seats.  When I pointed out the mess on the dash, initially they tried to say this was the dash paint wearing off. I was able to remove some of this white stuff (that looked a lot like a car wax) with my thumb nail. The manager, who I do not remember his name (nor is he worthy of being remembered) wanted to just get his day over and wanted to fill out a damage report. I remained reasonable but refused to just drop it because I knew they caused the problem. At this point 3 of the employees were involved and seemed more concerned with getting the day over than fixing the problem. They were disrespectful and discourteous.  Finally after they saw the light of day that it was not damage, but just some stuff that they managed to smear into the dash. They asked me to come back the next day. Obviously fixing the problem right then was just too much effort.  I went home, frustrated but moderately satisfied that the car would be fixed the next day.  The next day while examining the contents of the back seat that were just tossed about with no care, and no effort to clean anything, I discovered a pair of women's panties placed in the center of the floor of the back seat. Keep in mind that the floor mats were not vacuumed, but tossed on the back seat.   I knew these were not my wife's who is a small woman because these were of a rather robust size. Also these were obviously clean panties, so I gather that one of the employees has a fat girlfriend or wife who is missing something from the laundry.  I suspect these were a gift for my complaining about the condition of the car and the fact I was making them late from rushing home to see the next episode of moronic reality TV.  As a result I was livid. I had tried to be cooperative and reasonable and was rewarded with this insult added to injury.  I went to the 7700 location immediately and complained. They clearly found the actions of the yet undetermined employee very humorous, and were going to make no attempt to secure an apology or terminate the maleficent employee.   They reluctantly looked at fixing the area of the dash they had messed up, and made a halfhearted attempt to fix it. At this point the dash looked a little better but not the same as it did when I brought the car in. I was tired of dealing with these lazy incompetent fools who had no pride in their work and decided to take the car back to the 616 location.  Jared to the rescue:  I took the car directly to the 616 location and saw Jared busily working with his staff. I pulled up and was greeted courteously by one of the staff. After being checked in I called out to Jared and explained the situation to him. He dutifully sought out to resolve this issues and return my car to its former glory.  This was not his problem, his staff did not cause it but he fixed it.  Lesson: NEVER GO TO THE 7700 LOCATION! ALWAYS GO TO THE 616 LOCATION!  COBBLESTONE, BAD MANAGERS MAKE FOR A BAD STAFF. GREAT MANAGERS MAKE FOR A GREAT STAFF.","time_created":"2015-06-21 "}

For example serving Jewish Latkes, Israeli\/middle eastern humus, and Greek moussaka is usually just too much for a fusion.   And yet, the food was tasty! Even tough it wasn't 100% loyal to the original flavors or shapes of the Middle East the food was yummy! And I do have to give them a round of applause for their hummus. Simply really good!

The pre-pay service is great--the company takes the total cost of the evening and divides it per person, creating a link online where each girl can go and pay ahead of time.  We didn't have to deal with a large bill or everyone's credit cards at the end of the night.  It was SO easy.  Someone from the company was in constant contact with me leading up to our night out.  Sammy, knowing how large of a group we had and how important a good table was to us, called me the night of to let me know they'd had a different, better table open up, and that he was giving it to us at no extra charge.    Craig was our host for the evening.  He contacted me promptly to provide detailed instructions on where to meet him and when.

Paying an annual fee, I'm expecting receiving services which are at least at the average level; however, LifeScape disappointed me again and again over the years. I have to give credit to their office environment though, it's always quiet and clean, and the receptionists are always friendly.  There're a few reasons I don't like it there: 1. I feel like the doctor is always suggesting me with some medicine\/samples\/tests, and some of them are not necessary at all. For example, the doctor suggested me with a special blood test, twice, saying that the test would be very beneficial for me and my insurance should cover the cost. I believed her and had my blood drawn at their lab. Later I got a bill for almost $2000 (I know LifeScape always charges high prices, luckily I have a good health insurance so i don't really care, but still, $2000 for a blood test is too much! ) I called my insurance company, my insurance company said the test was actually done in a out-of-state lab so they will only pay for a small portion. I immediately called LifeScape and left a message, no one replied. A few days later I decided to go to their office in person, they lied to me that the blood test would just cost whatever my insurance company is willing to pay, and I would not be charged for extra. I believed them and left. But a few weeks later I received another bill. I called them a few more times explaining the issue. They told me that a specialist would call me back, but nobody ever did. I'm really disappointed. How can people trust them if they do business like that!!! What's worse, up to this day, they still haven't informed me anything about the bill, nor the blood test result itself.  2. The waiting time in the clinic is too long. I ALWAYS have to wait there for 30-50 minutes passed the appointment time. I know the doctor is busy, but the patient's time is precious too. I don't like taking my work hours off and just wasting it on waiting for the doctor. And when I finally get to meet with the doctor, I can tell that she is not patient enough. She seems in a hurry, I know she wants to finish up our conversation asap and move on to the next patient.  3. They don't have xRay machines. If you are need to get some xRay or CT scan done, I suggest you going somewhere else, even some small clinics have xRay machines.   I normally only write positive reviews online, but this time i want to let people know about what's really going on there. I would NOT go there any more and I do NOT recommend LifeScape to anybody.","time_created":"2011-11-29 "}

For me, it's just not worth it. Enter the Food Peddler Farmer's Market. I don't know whose idea it was to plop down a produce-centric farmer's market style grocery store in the heart of Cleveland's Old Brooklyn neighborhood, but I'd like to shake their hand. It's just what the doctor ordered.  Imagine, if you will, a bright, airy open market full of colorful fruit and vegetables from farms around the region, rows of farm fresh eggs, coolers filled with Amish chicken and local ground beef...yeah, right. No, really, it's true. I'm not saying this place is perfect, but for an area of Cleveland more known for it's shady strip mall bars and giant cemeteries it's a breath of fresh air. It does what Cleveland and the rest of the nation needs, it encourages consumption of fresh, local foods. So what do they have to offer?  -Fresh, seasonal fruits and vegetables with everything from plump bing cherries to more exotic fare like chayote and California avocados.   -A bakery with Cleveland favorites like kugel and kolaczki and a deli stocked to overflowing with meats and cheeses from all over Ohio and Pennsylvania.  -A bulk section with plenty of flour, rice, pie fillings, nuts, seeds, and other goodies.  -Giant bags of peanuts, onions, apples, and carrots.  -A wall of bulk candy packaged in little containers perfect for hiding in your cupboard behind the quinoa and flax seeds.  -Reasonable prices. It's not as cheap as fast food, no. But if you're gonna spend your money somewhere why not make it your health.  I could go on and on about all of the products they've managed to cram into this place and about how friendly the staff was but I want to leave something for you to find out on your first visit. I know, it's not the West Side Market and it doesn't have nearly the sheer volume of items of this venerable food mecca but it's worth paying them a visit anyway. What it does have is a neighborhood feel, more parking, and a more intimate experience. Support a local business, eat local foods and give something back.","time_created":"2013-08-03 "}

I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.  We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.    My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.    In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.","time_created":"2015-05-26 "}

Because I already have a dog at home, and my boyfriend wasn't able to join me, I put one of them on hold (they will hold your pet for the day) and went back a few hours later.  It is required that if you already have a dog, you must do an introduction to make sure it is a good match.  My dog loved Sayuri, but was not as fond of the other dog.  I like to say that my dog chose our new puppy :).    When adopting a puppy, you also recieve a free exam through the VCA Animal Hospitals.

Since the radiator was old the new water pump found a weakness in the radiator.  I was then told it was common???

I was told Caesar's Palace is the best, but I've never had it. From the looks of it, I'm sure its a million times better than this place. If you want a relatively less expensive buffet where most of the food is tasty and there's a fair amount of variety you might want to go here especially for the mimosa's. We got a great deal from tix4tonight. Definitely check out tix4tonight or a service like it before you go anywhere in Vegas.

I'll give them a few days to get back to me max. Hear nothing from them. Call them again, no answer. Call them again they finally answered. I explain the situation with guy that answers and he says \"Oh yeah i got your email but I forgot to call you.\". At this point I'm a little rubbed wrong with they're crap customer service. Then after that he tells me no I haven't cancelled and I'm going to have to pay another two months worth. He tells me I must have misunderstood him (he speaks broken English so he must have misunderstood me when I cancelled with him a month prior to this). He won't help me out at all, just says I have to pay more. Thank god I have Navy Federal for a bank because I call them after this and they let me know these guys shouldn't be changing me. They repay me for what the gym took and put a dispute on the gym, they also put a stop payment on the gym. Well sure and behold I get charged by them AGAIN and I call my bank asking why did this happen? Turns out this gym is manually putting my card information in to get past the stop payment. I ask what I can do. They say to email them so I have proof i contacted them in case they try to lie. So I email these dirt bags and guess what once again nothing but they email me the SCHEDULE FOR THE CLASSES. Once again my bank is helping me, thank goodness. Not veteran friendly.","time_created":"2016-06-03 "}

They use standard bowls to hold the shisha and you get 2 pieces of quick light charcoal.  Being a place that needs to get the customers satisfied, I understand why they use QL's but it will never beat the flavor and duration of a natural wood coal or even compressed coconut shell for burning. I could spend hours discussing their pitfalls and accolades in terms of only their Hookah side of the business but it would most likely just end up sounding drab. So I'll sum it up quick, if you've never smoked a hookah before and want a fairly decent experience, this place will give you a 65-75% good first smoke. If you are someone who is an avid smoker or owns your own pipe, what are you doing out paying for it elsewhere for? You know how it's done, do it up right.   Moving to their food and drink selections. My fiancee and I have tried most of their Juices and found them to be on the whole quite good. Their Oasis Cocktail has some kind of cream that we have yet to identify and I order without most of the time due to the particularly odd flavor it leaves lingering on the tongue.  My fiancee is partial to their strawberry and the banana-honey drinks and orders 2-3 of them at a time if we're there for a long visit.  The hummus was flavored pretty well, and when we ordered a shish-kabob it came out cooked right.  My last visit there I had Shawarma and it was good. Pretty solid foods, drinks, desserts, and hookah. Laid back atmosphere, heaters outside when it gets too cold.  The only thing that could use a smidge improvement is the serving girls are a tad hard to find and you can potentially go 30-45 minutes without seeing one anywhere. Give this place a shot if you're near the area.","time_created":"2009-10-13 "}

And she made up an excuse saying how \"Oh we wait on different tables probably your waiter is busy\" I knew this was an excuse, I was so disgusted. So we told the hostess that this waiter is waiting on a table after us, and she said oh well we said there would probably be a long wait, and the hostess had the audacity to say \"Oh but they serve the people who come before\" and I said, we were before them, we been waiting 30min at this table and you know this because you sat us at our table\" she said it depends.

The pick up process is pretty simple.  You can either go to a customer service rep or use their self-serve kiosk, which is what I ended up doing.  The lady who was assisting me on the kiosk phone was pretty friendly, but she was doing a lot of up-sell so it was kind of bothersome.  I didn't need a bigger car than an economy size since there was only 2 of us.  I understand that they probably work off of commission, but sometimes it's unnecessary to try and convince you to get something that you don't need.  The return process was pretty quick and easy as well.  I ended up getting charged for an extra day because I brought the car back 1.5 hours after the pick up time since my flight didn't leave until 8 PM.  Too bad they don't have a \"grace\" period for regular customers.  Other than that the car was fine.  I didn't get anything fancy, just a KIA so nothing much to write about--other than the fact that it was clean and didn't smell bad like some other rentals that I've encountered elsewhere.","time_created":"2016-09-18 "}

They administer a tablet form of survey asking about your condition and how it is affecting your life.

We picked this over Chippendales cuz the idea of Australian men with their accents is so much hotter than American dancers =P. When I called in to purchase tickets an hour before the show, they said that they didn't have a table to fit 5 girls, and that we would have to separate into two tables, which was fine. But when we got there, there was 2 completely empty tables in the front of the stage! The sales people were really unorganized to not notice that was available! So we ditched our booth and went straight to the front table, which gave a much better view.  The show was def entertaining, with finely sculpted men ripping off their shirts and dressing up in firemen\/spartan outfits ;) The occasional view of g-strings was not as welcome, something about a man in a g-string is just wrong, you know? but nonetheless, it was very entertaining. The emcee's accent was hot, and so was his bod. i think i found him the most attractive out of all the guys. They pulled a lot of the bachelorettes and birthday girls onstage to participate, and some of the older women too, which i thought was cool. They also ran around through the audience as well, so no matter where your seats were, I think you'd be able to get up close with one of the guys.  Downside though, at the end of the show, you are welcome to go to the front of the stage and pay $20 PER PERSON to take a pic with the guys, only to receive one picture. no offense, but that is a total rip off. i've been to Fantasy, which is a female stripshow,  and you can take pics with them for free, and they had much better attitudes and were a lot friendlier to talk to after the show. They were annoyed that we had stood in like and decided against taking the picture after the show, and even more annoyed when a girl behind us asked if they took credit card. wtf? These men seemed way too jaded and full of themselves. They may be good to look at, but off-stage they're total jerks.  Was this a good show?

We ended off with the 22 oz. porterhouse steak, which was cooked perfectly to order and was more than enough for the both of us.  Our server was friendly and insightful, and always catered to our needs at the table, other servers were also helpful but tended to their own tables. Although there were several mistakes on our bill initially, such as wrong food and drinks and extra items being billed, our server fixed everything easily.  The room itself was dimmed and the ambiance was more intimate.  In conclusion, the food quality is above standard, service and cleanliness is high, and the atmosphere is intimate.

We have three dogs of our own and we foster dogs, so when it started to heat up here in Vegas we were worried when the swamp cooler didn't seem to be blowing out air as cold as it normally does. I started reading reviews and messaging companies on yelp to see who, if any, would work on Swamp Coolers. The answer is, very few do, and most of the ones that do charge a high fee just to come take a look and provide an estimate, and often that fee doesn't apply towards the repair cost. Mr Cool didn't charge me an estimate fee and they had Derek come out to my house the very next day. Derek was thorough and investigated the problem and explained everything that was wrong without being condescending or acting like I was clueless. He offered his estimate for service and even told me I could shop around for other estimates to be certain I was getting a good price. I had already shopped around a bit so I was happy to proceed with their help.   Swamp cooler parts are very large so they don't have space to keep them in their vans, but Derek assured me he could buy the parts and complete the repair the very next day. I explained that my husband and myself would need to wait until Friday when we were getting paid for repair and he was kind enough to work with us so we could come to an arrangement for payment so we wouldn't have to deal with our house being so hot. He came back the next day and was here for a good amount of time as swamp coolers take more time for repair and he was very thorough and explained everything to me again. I asked questions about how to best maintenance our swamp cooler and he was happy to answer. I'm very glad we chose Mr Cool and would HIGHLY recommend Derek as he was so patient, kind, and hardworking. Swamp coolers are a pain for repair so if they were affordable for our repair I'm sure they're even better with AC units. Thank you Derek and Mr Cool, our house gets soooo cold now, just how I like it!","time_created":"2018-05-28 "}

Went here for the first time when I was in Vegas for my kickball tourney (WAKApalooza) early October. My teammate is a huge fan and suggested this place to the rest of the team for a big team dinner Saturday night.  It's located right next to the Flamingo Hotel where we were staying, so we were able to walk over. The restaurant is pretty big itself, but the tables are sort of cramped together in small rooms. The decor is awesome. Definitely a friendly, local vibe. Since our party was pretty big (about 14 of us), we had to wait a bit before getting a table. Not a big deal, since we started pre-drinking at the bar. The price range for the meals depends, but all range from $23-40. You get unlimited red or white wine with your meal though, plus all the meals come with Minestrone soup or Italian salad, garlic bread, pasta side & homemade Cappuccino. I ordered the lasagna and it was huge. I probably ate a quarter of it before I got full. I probably wouldn't have been as full if I hadn't filled up on garlic bread, but I couldn't help it - the garlic bread was ah-mazing. The cappuccino was really good too! More of a hot chocolate than coffee to be honest.  Service was good. They were kind enough to split our party in two, to help make the check easier. We even had a gentleman come serenade us with his accordian! I would definitely come back again.","time_created":"2013-11-14 "}

If you are a fan of fish dishes, this is a must as this is a delectable technique used for thousands of years in Iraq.  An entire fish is evenly flayed open and nailed to a plank of hickory wood, it is usually sprinkled with a little olive oil and perhaps some tamarind paste, and is then placed in a 45-degree angle by a charcoal fire.  Traditionally, large freshwater fish are used, but at chateau, the fish of choice is Tilapia - which is quite good and I suspect the best method to prepare this dish.  The result is a charred surface of the fish but all of the juiciness trapped inside - delectable.  It is not very often that I get the pleasure of enjoying a nice Masgoof.  In most cases, I find kabob houses to be boring and that isn't because I don't love the almighty Kabob, it's because I have come to expect that Kabob places outside of the Middle East, Detroit, and even Western Europe just can never get it right - every time there is hope, it normally ends in disappointment for me - I should have never made that trip to Iran in 2019 where I was in kabob paradise.  However, Chateau Kabob located in the Frankophilic metropolis of Montreal did me rare pleasure of maintaining that hope.  Here in Washington, DC we need to cling to places like Shamshiri and Alboorz to get our kabob fix but even that gets repetitive after a while - especially when there isn't a single Kabob house in the region that can even hold a candle to those two places and therefor isn't particularly incumbent of them to reach for the rating.  Chateau Kabob does it right and is about as close as you can get to some of the legendary places you can find in Iraq and Iran - the latter of which reigns supreme in the world of Kabobs.  At Chateau the spices are right, the juiciness is on par, and the meat is superb - all in all a very excellent Kabob.  And perhaps one of the most underappreciate techniques that Chateau also got right is the rice!  It is superb here - fluffy, velvety, and aromatic.  The interiors and décor of Chateau are good which kind of surprised me at first as I've come to expect that most other Persian or Arab restaurants (as expected) sport some of the most gaudy and hideous interiors known to man.  It appears that these guys were tasteful and enlisted the help of someone to actually DESIGN the space with thoughtful layout and pleasant finishes.  Some aspiring Middle Eastern Restauranteurs tend to think that they are the best interior designers on the planet - that is until they actual design their space.  I'm glad the guys at Chateau hired a designer - that along with the fish, the delicious kabob, and good company makes Chateau a pleasurable experience worth revisiting if you are ever in Montreal and seriously have a hankering for kabobs.  Hats off to the owner and chef who are always in the restaurant tending to guests - some of the nicest people you'll meet.","time_created":"2015-07-03 "}

In addition, we wanted coffee refills and no one ever came back to ask us!!  When I inquired about the no cheese the server told me no it doesn't come with it, and when I asked the owner she said that that isn't the correct way western omelets traditionally  are served! She argued with me about the history of the western omelet instead she should have been more focused on her customers being happy, especially since we I told her it was our first time there and we were excited to try her food Quite honestly, I don't look for a class lesson when I go out to eat I just want good food and good customer service, I got neither today!  The correct thing for the server and the half wit owner would have been to say, \" sorry sir but I would be happy to redo your omelet with cheese and make u another order of hash browns and make sure they are crispy\".  But guess what none of that happened!  I have cooked in restaurant my whole life and I have never heard of any omelet not coming with some type of cheese and even if she was correct in her history, she definitely failed me at her customer service skills. In addition, when paying for my food I was told that they only take cash so I had to go out and get cash to pay for this horrible experience and that didn't sit well with me, I almost said screwed it, but my conscience said don't do it, so I went back and paid my bill.

The first was on Administrative Professionals' Day for lunch.  It was packed and the food was delicious.  As is the usual with Vintner, the service was not great.  Our waiter was friendly (when we saw him), but he just couldn't keep up in his section.  Hubby and I also went back on a Friday at 2:15 for a liquor lunch, and I must say it was one of the best dining experiences we have had in Las Vegas.  The food was excellent as it has always been.  However, for the first time, the service (by Mark), was impeccable.  Was it because there were only a few tables?  Possibly, but something tells me that I have found my go-to server from now on.  He made great recommendations, and the timing of everything was amazing.  Sitting outside and enjoying champagne was heavenly.  Please go to Vintner Grill.  It is worth the drive from the Strip.  Just be patient in case the service is a little slow.  Besides, you never know what celebrity you may see!","time_created":"2013-05-07 "}

Chinese - Mexican - Jamaican Fusion Fast Casual (or as I like to call it - Confusion!) It's a Phoenix original.  It's been on Diner's Dives and Drive Ins.  If it's your first time, go up to the counter (to the left of the cash registers) and ask for the orientation - they'll walk you through the ordering process, and give you samples of several of the dishes.  After you do that, grab an order form and pick a 2 item combo and choose 7 9 Black and White.  That's all your really need to know.  :-)  That's Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Black Beans and White Rice.  Jade Red Chicken is sort of their take on sweet and sour, but with a spicy twist.  Jerk Chicken is Jamaican influenced (and can be quite spicy some days).  The Black Beans are amazing - stir them into your rice (easier to eat both with your chopsticks when you do this).  And, did I mention, you get a snickerdoodle with your order?  Yep!  Best snickerdoodles around, and one comes with every dish!

Doctor Youssef first helped my boyfriend when his cat had a horrible hairball stuck in her stomach. He shows so much compassion and understanding for animals it is hard not to believe he truly cares for their well being.  He is not afraid to tell you if you are harming your pet. If they are overweight, he will tell you straight up and let you know you are causing them harm. If you are an uptight suburbian, then don't go to him. He will tell you that you are killing your dog feeding them 'Puppocinos'. Which you are.  I started taking my dog here after she expressed her hatred of her previous vet, who felt that it was 'no big deal' and that they could always just muzzle her or setime_created her for check ups. I felt that was ridiculous and brought her to Doctor Youssef who felt the same and is doing everything in his power to make her comfortable with him and his staff. He has even let me take her around the whole building just to get use to it.   His prices are very fair, and he himself is the most trustworthy vet I have yet to meet. One conversation with him and you can tell he does not care about money, he is truly one of the very few who are in this business just because they care about animals.  I love this guy so much I recommended him to my best friend when she got her cat, and she takes it to him as well. She got the cat spayed and he offered to keep it overnight for free!

Definitely a hidden gem in the GTA. But please be very very careful and get everything in writing. George Christakis the co-owner of this venue and manager of Crystal Fountain is very devious and sketchy.   We had checked out a few venues, one being Crystal Fountain, where we met George. He was definitely rude, and lacked professionalism. We left with a very bad impression.  Fast forward a few week, and we spotted Estate banquet, we emailed and arranged to meet up. We showed up and the one we had the appointment with was no where to be seen, having passed our meeting off to someone else without informing us. The venue is beautiful an price was in our budget and we wanted to proceed once we could work out the food details. My girlfriend did not like the unprofessional manner of George, whom I later found out when I asked is indeed the same George from Crystal Fountain.  We called George the next day to discuss food options, and he said yes everything we wanted we could have for the price we discussed. Tasting was included for 6 people. I asked him to send me an email confirming what we spoke about on the phone. When the email arrived it simply had generics such as \"assorted veggies, assorted cakes, hors d'oeuvres\" as well as a tasting for 2 people. As well he upped the amount of people we had to guarantee for the price.  When we called back to discuss, he verbally told us again what it would include, but when I asked him to email us specifics, he refused. In a very arrogant tone he informed us that he was an expert in his field, and he does not give specifics. That grilled veggies, will be based on what he can buy for that price when the wedding arrives, almost a year later. That it's his discretion what desserts and pastries he would provide.   Needless to say, I told him unless we could establish a written contract outlining what he would be providing for the price we were paying, we would be walking away. He said no way is he going to put anything details down in writing, and that we were to trust him. We walked.  Please be very wary of this George, he is very unscrupulous. The venue itself it nice, and private, but no way was I going to ruin such a special day by getting involved with such shady business dealings.","time_created":"2014-12-17 "}

Did not disappoint! A 9 table restaurant, intimate, contemporary but not stuffy decor, washrooms spotless, service friendly and on point. They truly want your dining experience to be a cut above the rest. They are attentive without being intrusive and the FOOD.... the gnocchi was suggested to us by a guest seated nearby who heard we were new to town. This selection was wonderful, pillowy dumpling puffs with lobster and truffle oil... I was sold! My husband and I shared this plate of deliciousness and the restaurant will split the plate for you in the kitchen, no problem. The fresh bread came with shallot butter - WOW, a must try, I love flavoured butters! For the main meal trio, I got the Dock Side which is a perfect scallop, perfect shrimp and the most tender, buttery fish filet once can ask for. My husband chose the meat option and he too could only describe his filet as \"butter\" and loved everything else that accompanied it. The small hot pots with the fresh veg inside in a butter broth were hits as well! The sparkling volcanic water was a nice change for us and the wine list was beyond impressive. We each had one glass, a red and white. MMMMM! Everything here is 100% Italian including the waiters and it was so nice to see how knowledgeable they are about the menu and passionate about what they serve! The chef obviously took a lot of pride in her work and created for us, THE perfect plates! The end of the meal sadly came and although we were stuffed, we chose to share the lemon curd with berries plate to cleanse the palate. The best choice we could of made - or was it?! We will have to find out next time we come! We enjoyed the location of Capo in Inglewood, quite central and the waiter who called a taxi for us even waited with us outside chatting with us until the cab came. What a gem of an eatery if you can afford to splurge now and then! A highlight of my week and would recommend to anyone!","time_created":"2011-11-30 "}

I will admit the experience was much different than what I have experienced at other \"traditionally American\" spas. For example, there are 3 beds in the massage room so multiple people can get massaged at the exact same time. In my opinion, this is quite odd and it is not something I am a fan of. Thankfully, only my cousin and I were in there at the same time but I imagine it might be quite awkward to be in there, without clothes, with strangers. Given, you are covered at all times, but still odd.  I had the 70-minute Kung-Fu Hot Stone Full Body Massage with Lavender Bubble Tea Foot Spa. The massage was delightful...very calming and relaxing (with the exception of when the masseuse worked out a knot I had in my back, which I am grateful for!). enjoyed the generous application of massage gel\/oil\/lotion and the hot stones made for a nice treat. The foot spa portion was just ok...it basically consisted of soaking my feet in a bucket filled with warm water for about half an hour. The bucket was heavily textured in the shape of \"bubbles\" at the bottom, which I guess was the \"bubble tea\" part of it. While I did expect and had hoped for more, the warm water surrounding my feet was nice.  The staff was friendly overall (with the exception of when my cousin and I were quite literally shushed so be sure to speak only in whispers, if at all). What was most interesting, though, was the fact that they literally ask for a tip of at least $15. They do this by handing you your pre-service questionnaire and then asking you to fill out the back portion, which consists of one question asking how much tip you will leave and the lowest option is $15. I would advise the business to take this out of their process and simply allow clients to tip on their own.","time_created":"2018-05-29 "}

First of all, I was assigned a guy who told me he was newly hired and he was sooooo sweet. However, after the appointment I had hot roots and my black was still there in the rest of my hair (the guy spent half and hour rubbing my roots with a brush and scalp and completely hurt it). The owner of the salon \"approved\" my colour and told me it looked good (lol) and I paid 160$ total.  They told me that it looked black because of the light btw. When I arrived home I realized that in natural light it looked waaayyy worse. I called them, they re-scheduled an appointment because they totally recognized me... and I wasted again my time with the same guy and left with an orange- toned black\/brown. He applied a toner instead of trying to bleach again and left it there for and hour....At that point I was over it and I calmly left without causing any drama. Obviously, the owner let me go with that shitty colour again knowing that it was not what I asked for (or asked to fix).  Basically, if you are looking to bleach your black box-dyed hair do not waste your money in this salon. It takes professionals to do that and, in my opinion, both the owner and the hairstylist that was assigned to me lacked of professionalism and honesty.","time_created":"2016-06-11 "}

I was going to eat here once before, thank God I didn't because the place looked like a zoo inside. Very chaotic and the staff clearly had no idea how to manage reservations and walk-ins during a busy weekend dinner rush. A couple months later I called to place an order for lunch delivery and apparently they don't deliver. A Chinese restaurant - in Brampton - with no delivery? Seriously???   So making bad decisions as a business is their owner's problem, except when they hire rude and condensing staff to man the phones and their host table. He tried to save the order after I advised him the other three Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood all deliver - by asking me \"how much food do you want to order, we only deliver for over $70 and it comes from Mississauga\". So tons of cold Chinese food from a different city - yummy! I'm not sure the guy could even spell the words \"food poisoning\" lol.  Don't be fooled by the pretty website and modern look of this place, service is the same as most Brampton Chinese\/Hakka restaurants - terrible. If thats how they man the host table and phones I can't imagine what eating there would be like. Actually I can, it would probably sbe exactly like all the other poor reviews I've read on here. If you're craving Chinese or Hakka in this part of town switch cuisine types because its all disappointing. Go to Markham or Toronto for great Chinese food, Brampton will only let you down.","time_created":"2016-03-07 "}

Brightly lit and rather spacious the place never became loud despite having fairly high ceilings and a good sized dinner crowd.   I ordered a lemon drop martini and the fish and chips. Now, I'll admit I was envisioning what I had seen in most places - many little pieces of fish and some fries. Instead what came out was a very large fish fillet that was breaded very lightly and plenty of delicious fries. The fish was fantastic. It was cooked wonderfully, the breading was crisp and salty, and the fish itself was flaky. It was amazing.   The service was below average. Our waitress came by only twice - to take our order and deliver the check. Someone else delivered the food and as I charged the food to the room I didn't even see who took the bill. Our water glasses and our martini glasses were emptied without anyone offering to refill our water or ask if we wanted another drink. No one else checked on us. I would normally be more forgiving if they were packed and extremely busy but they were only moderately busy and I saw plenty of staff, but they were rarely in the dining room instead frequently disappearing in the nearby kitchen often with nothing in hand and ignoring my pitiful attempts to flag someone down.   The food was easily a 5, the drinks a 4, but the service was a 2 at best.","time_created":"2016-01-30 "}

Around 10:00pm, they brought out a bunch of appetizers (excellent baba ghanoush, hummus, lebneh with mint, Shanklish (which is a middle eastern blue cheese type of cheese ball), tabouleh, Kibbeh nayyeh (which is raw meet so I was pretty skeptical about but was delicious) and lots of pita.  You can keep asking for more of any of these items.  Around 11:00pm a singer came out.  Although I couldn't understand what she was singing, she sounded good to me and people got up to dance which was fun.  Around midnight, they brought out the meat (chicken and beef kabobs and kafta).  By this time of course, you are STUFFED but I had a bit of everything and it was all pretty tasty.  I don't think you can ask for more meat but truthfully, I don't know how anyone could anyway.  Then, a belly dancer came out and I think she gave about a 30 minute show and it was really good.  After that they bring out Turkish coffee and some sort of cheese dessert.  Then the singer came on again and sang until closing.  We stayed until 3:00am.  I would definitely recommend going to this place!

The restaurant is located on the second floor of the mall and is really easy to find.  It's located next to other restaurants in Crystals such as Social House and Mastro's.  It's open restaurant seating gives it the feeling of a food court type establishment.  But obviously much more upscale to align with the Wolfgang Puck branding.  I admit, I've heard great things about it before from other friends.  I'm also a big fan of Italian food so I was anxious to try it.  So we came here late on a weekday night.  There was no wait and the restaurant was light.  We decided to sit at the bar as there was happy hour bar menu.  I'm not sure if that was a good choice.  While the service here is great, the prices for what you get in food and atmosphere were not.  Now don't get me wrong.  The food isn't bad, but I expected more given the reputation and prices.   The food itself is tasty.  They seem to keep their approach on food very simple... which I prefer.  But overall, I think that there are better alternatives for the prices.  ie. Trattoria Reggiano at the Venetian  To mention, we had: -  Roasted Cauliflower -  Wild Mushrooms Porchini -  Steamed Spinach -  Spaghetti and Meatballs -  Asparagas Salad with Panna Cotta and Prosciutto  I'm sorry Wolfgang, but I'm not a fan.","time_created":"2013-01-28 "}

Lots of lunch dish choices and you can get most of them for less than $10. When you get anything fried (general Tso's, sesame chicken, etc.) the fried outside usually has a good crunch to it. It's not soggy like these dishes can end up being at many other Chinese places. The long-short of it though is this is otherwise just your basic Chinese food served on a nice plate in a nicer restaurant with good décor and trendy music.  At lunch time they're pretty empty and the service isn't bad as a result. The staff tend to disappear though and take some time to come back and check on you. It is at least a more relaxed experience because of there being less people in the restaurant. They could stand to uptime_created\/repair\/landscape the exterior of the building a bit.

They'd been closed for a long, long time. Too long.   I've only ever had delivery from here, but I plan to actually go in one day. Really. I do. Just... I like delivery. And they're fast, good, and inexpensive. I use the word inexpensive on purpose - because cheap Chinese delivery conjures images of gross things. Everything I've ever gotten from them has been solidly good, if not great.   Panda Wok is really your typical Americanized Chinese food - the standard fare is all here, and they don't do anything special to make it feel \"authentic\" -- but I'll be honest here and admit sometimes I want the Americanized version of stuff. It's kind of like comfort food. And that they do well.   The Singapore noodles are hands down my favorite - even if they don't always get the spicy request quite right (sometimes it's too spicy, sometimes not spicy enough). The meat (pork, chicken, and shrimp) is always good and fresh - some other reviewers have said otherwise, but I can tell you that I've never had any complaint about low quality meat in any of my orders... and I've ordered from there more than I should probably admit. The fried rice isn't loaded with frozen peas and carrots (a personal nitpick of mine, but makes a huge difference) and the egg drop soup isn't too thick with cornstarch.   The delivery is always super fast -- they always tell me 45 min or more - but it's never been more than 30. And the food is sometimes still too hot to eat right away. Granted, I only live a mile away, but still, it impresses me.   Welcome back Panda Wok, even if my waistline suffers my enthusiasm.","time_created":"2014-04-20 "}

For those of you not familiar with the area, the location of this business is absolutely amazing. Two major crossroads in Scottsdale, great traffic from big stored next door and quite simply, a great little place.  However, keep in mind that people shop with their eyes. That said, when you walk into a business, that first impression makes a huge impact on many things. Let me give you a summary:  When you walk in, you'll see that they have turned the place into a warehouse to keep all of their inventory (drinks, food, plastic cups, napkins, etc...) but instead of having a designated storage room for that, everything is just all over the place (around the tables, vending machine, register, counter, etc...). My advice to the owners\/managers is simple. Please keep the place organized, make it look like a place to eat and make people want to sit down and enjoy a nice meal over there. One of the employees was cutting veggies on one of the tables for customers. I really hope they take my review as good feedback and not as bad feedback. They have so much potential, a little organization, clearing up and cleaning up with go insanely far.  The food itself isn't bad at all.

On a negative note; they say they support Luke Air Force Base and military personnel, but they can't get anybody veteran plates for their vehicles. But you pay documentation fees to them, to deal with paper work related stuff with DMV. When I bought a car last year, that dealer had no problem getting my veteran plates. Now I can go spend two hours at the DMV. Then I come to find out couple days later that they didn't even fix the third brake light on the vehicle, which is a safety issue and couple of things that is safety related. There was another issue with the vehicle that they told me that the vehicle was designed that way. When I was talking to a guy at Starbucks he showed me how to fix the issues(I understand it's a Toyota dealership, when a guy at Starbucks show me how to fix it, it says a lot about your mechanics). And also particular used vehicle I bought, particular dealership sits right next-door to them. I stop in at that dealership and asked them about the issue and they told me that it was not designed that way and no vehicle is designed that way after 60s no matter the make. I just hate being lied to, says a lot about people's character. Just protect yourself on buying a car because dealerships will lie to you to get your business or I should say your money.","time_created":"2016-07-04 "}

The reasons for this are:  1) The $3 lb of wings seems really appealing. Too bad it is EXTREMELY misleading. They give you 5 TINY wings and force you to order an (overpriced) drink with it. If you want to order another lb, you have to order ANOTHER drink. Your $3 lb turns into $18.  *Important to note: NO FREE REFILLS when a soft drink is $4. Ridiculous, right?   2) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to go up FIVE seperate times to the bar. The first time was to ask where our waitress was. The second was for napkins. Third was for the menu since their wing promotion was VERY disappointing. Fourth was for water. Fifth was to get our bill.   *Note- you would think the waitress would come to your table since you asked for a menu which means you were contemplating ordering more food. Stupid.  *She also did not ask how anything was.   3) They charge you an extra DOLLAR for dipping sauce.... when it should come with one. There is also no carrots or celery.   4) Our server was too busy flirting with old men to give proper customer service.    There were only two or three servers so Manager if your reading this you should probably try to go through your chits and see who ordered 2 lbs of BBQ wings, 1 Diet Coke and 1 Sprite, and see who the server was.

The service I received was excellent!  When I went for lunch, the atmosphere was very relaxed, and the bartender was very attentive.  Same goes for breakfast, even though it was much busier during the breakfast visit (I overheard a server saying they're busiest during the breakfast times).  For breakfast, I went with a tried and true, biscuits and gravy, which comes with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, and potatoes.  My server asked me if I wanted some chorizo on my potatoes, which was unexpected, but later I saw that their lunch special was tacos with chorizo.  I probably should have steered clear of the chorizo, as it was a bit much, but I didn't look at the special board before I came in.  For those who like extras though, it was nice that he offered and didn't charge for it.  The biscuits were slightly disappointing, I'm sad to report.  They had a good flavor, but they were a little overbaked to the point where they were almost hard.  Also, the parts that didn't have gravy on them actually tasted of slightly burned biscuit.  :(  This saddened me, but didn't take away from the meal too much.  When I went for lunch the previous week, I got the grilled chicken sandwich, which comes with bacon on it and avocado.  The sandwich tasted awesome!  This time, the only downside was a matter of mechanics.  The bacon\/avocado would not stay between the bun (which was a bacon focaccia, I believe... yum!) when I'd bite into it.  Not that big of a deal.  I mean, the sandwich fillings were hefty!  Anyhow, good food here.  Excellent service.  Try it out if you're in the neighborhood!","time_created":"2014-03-15 "}

I'm not sure what's up with that.  The food is quite delicious -- definitely comfort food. Their fake chicken stuff is spot-on. We ordered the wings as appetizers (in buffalo sauce) and I had the chicken burger -- enjoyed them both. I will say that the chicken burger patty was a relatively generic one, pretty sure I could buy that off the shelf of a vegetarian food store. My friend had the unchicken and waffles and it looked awesome. The only thing we weren't particularly impressed with was the mac and cheese. Both my friend (who is vegan) and I (not vegan) felt that it was not particularly satisfying as far as mac and cheeses go.   By the way, in case you missed the point, it's comfort food, and not exactly something meant to be particularly \"fresh\" or \"healthy.\" It's all about the heavy sauces and meat alternative products here. So if you're the type of hipster that's trying to avoid processed foods, eat raw, and more or less graze like a cow, I'd skip this joint.

He said I can start taking 3 times a day instead of 2. And now I'm running out of my meds because no pharmacy would fill it before the 30-day period since it's controlled substance. I'm stuck with just enough for one a day for the next 10 days and I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms daily. Doctor basically told the staff to tell me to make it last. Ashley, who does the prescription, attacked me for taking 3 a day and said to me that I should only take those as needed. Why am I being blamed?  Cristy at the front desk was the only person with sympathy and only person that thought it didn't make sense for the doctor to tell me to take 3 when I only have access to 2 a day for a month.","time_created":"2017-04-20 "}

I actually think I prefer it over GA because unless you are in the very front I think you'd be struggling to see (unless you're tall). Btw, once the show started, nobody was sitting.

My husband and I were seated a nice table for our anniversary dinner last night.  We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and decided on an appetizer.  In the past, we have ordered cheese plates but we decided to order:  *Crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli ($12)  I wish we didn't order it.  It was rubbery and the aioli had a very strange flavor.  After eating two rings of calamari, I had enough of the rubber.  Surprisingly enough, the waiter never asked how the appetizer was.   But he did come over to ask what we wanted as a main course.  I'm guessing there weren't any specials of the night, since it was never offered.  I ordered: *Seared sea scallops with saffron risotto, english peas, fennel, pea sprouts and roasted pepper relish ($31) -The scallops were MASSIVE and very good.  But the risotto tasted like a box of rice-a-roni (yuck!)  The roasted pepper relish that was on top of each scallop was unnecessary as it caused the inside of the scallops to turn pink, which then makes you think, \"could this be raw inside?\"  My husband ordered: *Durham ranch wagyu sirloin with parsnip puree, baby vegetables and balsamic-port reduction ($27) -He said it was good, but the wagyu at T-Bones at Red Rock (if you can believe it!) was MUCH better.  In fact any wagyu that he has had anywhere else was better than this.  We ordered our dessert to go: Which was a trifle with granola, strawberries and pound cake.  It was yummy!  There are restaurants in the area that have better food; the ambiance at Vintner Grill is terrific- but that is what you are paying for.  Unfortunately, I am no longer a fan and will not be visiting anymore.  Such a shame since I live about five minutes away.","time_created":"2013-05-07 "}

I have wanted to check out this place, I host an monthly breakfast club that runs on Sat, and though that this could be a cool place to check out, but when reading the menu it clearly states that they can host parties of up to 30 people, but on WEEKDAYS only, well guess this place is out of the BC loop.  When I 1st walked in a few things hit me  1) Plenty of signs on the door, inside the place and around the place that elude you to believe it's a cash only place and they have an ATM inside the joint, but on the door it states they take Visa & MasterCard, yep skipped the ATM fee and I ponied up the Visa  2) Did I just go to Miami? The inside of the place is painted as a cool little beach diner, white\/cream and aqua colors, but like a 50's cool diner, this wasn't an new place   3) Signs stating to turn off Cell phones, um ok, I understand that in a small room it would be sort of rude to carry on a conversation, but people can text, and well play games, my phone was set to silent and while I was waiting to be waited on I did text & play a game   4) Hope the people around you are friendly because they are sitting just an elbow bump away, but it was ok with us, had a nice couple next to us and he commented on how it's like dinning on a cruise being close to fellow diners.  5) I being 40 felt like the new kid on the block, so I'm guess my daughter who is 22 felt really young haha  Also, again on being close to everyone you can hear what others are ordering or not ordering, and on the menu it stated that the house specialty is the Apple Pancake, and I was interested in trying it, but overheard another table inquiring about it and they were told it was a 45 min wait for the Apple Pancakes, and it's not that I was in a rush I just wasn't into waiting 45 mins to try it, maybe call a head for it?   After checking out the menu, and yes they have a few different types of pancakes, but nothing really wowed me, but I did see a Bacon stuffed pancake and you betcha that's what I ordered and ordered a side of home fries. The pancakes come with real butter and 2 ounces of syrup, for me that was not enough I like a little bit of pancake with my sweet sticky maple syrup, I did ask for more, but it still wasn't enough, some\/most of the pancakes were dry, and I don't like them that way, but the bacon was a thick slice bacon, so very good, bacon and maple syrup is the best combo ever!   The home fries looked amazing, but they were under cooked, the potatoes were a little to hard for me.   Service was slow, it was weekday morning, so the place was semi steady , we were not check on to see if we needed\/wanted anything but after 5 mins of getting our food our bill was presented to us and I was told we can take care of that at the front, kind of felt like it was a hurry up eat and get out kind of thing.

Artificial fragrance air freshener overwhelms the restaurant and bathrooms. Subpar food. Bright Lime Green walls gives off a cheap feel.   The owner did not smile once. She demanded we sit in the corner under the TV. We instead walked over to another table. She then rudely told us we cannot sit there \"in case a big group comes in\". No group ever came.   The pad woon sen was really bad, tasted of toasted sesame and did not have any oyster or fish sauce. Not authentic.   The only positive things were that they used filtered water, which is rare at a restaurant in Arizona, and the place was very clean.   Prices: $11 to $18. Overpriced for what you get, like most Thai restaurants in AZ.   The curry was ok, nothing spectacular but a decent serving size. Even Mild was way too spicy for me.   Due to the extreme rudeness of the owner (Asian lady), and the ridiculous air freshener smell, we will not return and DO NOT recommended at all.   There are so many better Thai options in the East Valley. For example: in Tempe, Thai Basil, Tasty Thai, and Smile Lao Thai are way way better.

Our sole purpose in stopping in was to grab food.   The parking lot is very odd and tiny. You will be very surprised if you get parking. We parked on the street.  Upon arriving we could hear the chatter and noise from inside outside.   Inside most of the booths were empty while the bar was packed.  We ordered wings and shooters. A lot of their wing flavors seem very spicy. So I chose the Meso Honey flavor. It was delicious. My friend had the original blackened  wings. I wanted to try the Kiss My Castmast shooter but they were out of some of the ingredients. So I chose a Absolut Gummy Bear shooter made with peach vodka. It wasn't good. Idk if it was because I substituted for another vodka flavor but I will never order that again.   All in all I'm glad to know that there is an option for late night eats in the Park Road area.

I was grandfathered in under my Dad who is a retired USAF Lt. Colonel. Actually, I first started dealing with them directly when I opened my first Master Card as an 18 year old before moving out and going to college. And then soon after I dealt with USAA's customer service line numerous times because my car loan and car insurance are through them.  Whenever I called them about anything their customer service representatives have been angels. I say they've been angels because compared to other customer service reps at other companies I've spoken to these people have to be from another plane of existence to consistently be so amazing. I've called crying because I locked my keys in my car, or just confused over something having to do with registering my car and not being able to get my proof of insurance printed out in enough time (gee, the wonders of a irresponsible teenage college student). But every time they have been great. Going on 9 years now they have never let me down.  As soon as I snag myself a full time job I am moving my checking account over to USAA. They offer direct deposit and deposit from home. They also offer a set amount of money to be returned to your bank account at the end of every month if you happen to take out money at one of those nasty ATMs that charge you an arm and a leg for use. I hate that and knowing I could get that money back would be awesome.   My plan is to be with USAA forever. I have no reason to switch to anyone else. They've been in my family for a long time.

On a day out with my mom we could not decide what we wanted to eat, but I was starving for something different. She said we could eat Greek, something something chicken, at first I was hesitant, \"chicken\", it's not my favorite meat, but I was up for the challenge. As soon as we got to Parsley during this monsoon-like Las Vegas weather a huge raindrop landed in my eye, I guess it must have been good luck that I was visually impaired, it was indeed a sign from Zeus himself saying \"Feast on the nectar of the Gods my dear child.\".  Luckily this place not only has Chicken Shawarma but also Beef Shawarma so I opted for the latter in wrap form with all the works and an added treat of those beautiful olives. The serving size was more than enough for me, I could only eat half my wrap, and beware these wraps can get messy.

The layout if this place is pretty small. I'd say 30 people max? There is outdoor seating though.

I wish it was closer, but it's worth the trip.  Since I'm turning into an old person, I like watching movies during the day and only paying $5 on weekday\/nights and then $5 before 4pm on Friday, Saturdays, and Sundays.  They keep this theater clean and it's easy to go shopping at Concord Mills after a long movie session where you need to stretch your legs.  There are a couple of times where I've been here on premier nights, which is cool because of the crowds, but I would much rather wait for the middle of the week when I have the option of lifting up all the arms and laying across a row.  Don't get me wrong, it really just depends on who sits next to you in a crowded theater:  the person with the screaming baby, the person texting away, the person answering phone calls!, or the person chatting away with a friend, or the person that has to make a comment about everything in the movie like we aren't watching the same thing.

The building houses a Cross-Fit gym, batting cages, climbing wall and basketball court.  The basketball court is in great condition and is used for basketball camps.  The climbing wall is decent, but there's no marked climbs and the cost is pretty ridiculous ($8 a climb v. $10 a day in another climbing gym).    I went for the batting cages which have a great set up with a mock field and mock home run background.  However, the machines are old and not maintained well (4 out of every 14 pitches are low or deeply inside).  The batting cage cost is a little high too ($2 for 14 pitches).  This place could be amazing with the fake field and wall, but the poorly maintained machines and bad pitching ruin the place.  All in all, this place is a monument to what could be an amazing local sports place\/community center.  Instead, it's just a rundown place with moments of genius.","time_created":"2010-07-08 "}

Since I was staying at the Palms, it was only natural that I wander in. It was about 8 of us and after about a 45 minute wait we were seated. I was astonished to see just how pricey the menu was, especially the wine list. But when in Vegas, party like a rockstar. So I went for the Lobster and Filet mignon ($59). The meat was so tender and juicy it just melted in your mouth like hot butter. I also got to try the Porterhouse and it was a thing of beauty. I love steak, I love it and this place right at the top of my list. I also got to try the French Onion soup and I have to say that it was the best soup I ever had. For 8 of us, the bill totaled about $700. Not your everyday steakhouse but if your looking for something out of this world, strap on and they will take you there.","time_created":"2011-06-29 "}

I've been told that they now carry gluten free bread, but since I am so paranoid about getting sick, I'd rather avoid the possibility of cross contamination and go for a salad.  The salads are not cheap, but they do give you a variety of lettuces to choose from (spring mix, spinach, iceberg and romaine) and there are a TON of toppings to choose from. The biggest issue I found was that the amount of toppings you get (I believe it's 3\/salad) is not really enough. I have concerns about meat from delis because they generally are processed with wheat so I stuck to kidney beans, chickpeas and tomatoes. The amount of beans was literally about a scoop and a half with a small plastic spoon. I requested more kidney beans and was charged an additional $0.50. I could buy a whole can for that price!  I was worried about choosing a salad dressing where I couldn't read the ingredients, and the employee hauled out the massive bottle under the counter for me to read the ingredient list - that made me pretty happy!   Overall, the salads are delicious, and in my non-gluten free days I remember their sandwiches as being pretty great too. They are expensive, but at least the food tastes good for what you're paying. I don't think I'd return unless I forgot my lunch again, but only because I don't like paying for something I can make at home for a fraction of the cost.","time_created":"2013-10-24 "}

Now this is the 1st time I've been to one since 2001, back when it was THE place to hit after many, many drinks.  So this time was different, I am now much older, much more sober, and with a well defined palate....ha....perfect for Steak 'n Shake right?  Well the wife went with the double cheese burger, straight up standard version and I went with the Portabello Swiss with mayo.  We both opted for cheese on our fries.  Well, to be perfectly honest, it wasn't that bad.  The mushrooms were fresh, had a little firmness to them, not the soggy mess I was expecting.  The meat was seasoned well and tasted really good for a fast food type burger.  I normally like my burgers medium but I knew I wasn't getting that here so I just sucked it up and enjoyed my meal.  The cheesy fries were small, probably would have preferred larger fries with more content, but the cheese (yellow crack) added that extra kick that makes you feel all better.  So I hate to say it, but I liked my meal, so did the wife.  We will consider it again next time we are in a bind and need something quick other then Taco Bell.  This location was clean, not very busy, but that was good in a way that we were given full service by the manager, refills and extra napkins without getting up.  Way to earn that $8.50 an hour!!","time_created":"2010-11-24 "}

We arrived a bit early yesterday for happy hour, only to find that happy hour was cancelled due to the Rush concert at US Airways. Who cancels a published happy hour? So clearly, they just wanted to make more money off of the concertgoers with no regard to the typical customer. We ordered drinks for the lot, only to be asked every 20 seconds to get out of the way of the serving staff because the place was so packed and there was barely even standing room. There was no way to not be in the way. We got seated on the patio (because an inside table was a 2-hour wait) pretty quickly. However, the misters were broken at the table we were seated at - they worked fine at all of the other patio tables, but not ours. There didn't seem to be any regard for the fact that it was 107°. We asked to be reseated, they said they couldn't accommotime_created us anywhere else. We asked about a group of 2-tops that were available, were told they were reserved. I offered to sit at the table with the broken misters until something else opened up, but they said they didn't know how long it'd be before another table opened up. We were pretty much ready to leave (I had said we'd just pick up some wine and go back to my place to make pizzas) when the \"reserved\" 2-tops suddenly became available and were rearranged to accommotime_created us. The server acted like we were a complete bother to him, like he'd rather be somewhere else with a different group of people. Really didn't engage us very much. The appetizers were fantastic (shrimp and pretzels) and were gone in a heartbeat. Three of the eight of us ordered the prime rib. I joked that I didn't even want mine cooked (i.e., as rare as possible), and the server told me it was already cooked and my request was not possible. I was kidding, of course, but it wasn't received very well. When our food came, only one of us was given horseradish to accompany our prime rib. When I asked for horseradish for the other two, the server said, \"oh, you want more?\" No, I want SOME. I would say my prime rib was medium-rare at best. It was OK, pretty fatty, but that's a risk you take with prime rib, I suppose. I was going to order another glass of wine, but I couldn't get the attention of the server and he didn't come back to the table to check up on us very frequently. When he brought me a to-go box, I had asked for more au jus and horseradish to-go, so he brought me an empty container to put my remnants in instead of fulfilling my request of new. We usually meet at 6:00 and don't leave until about 9 or 10, usually sit around and have a few drinks while we chat. But this time, we all left by 8 and all went our separate ways. The consensus among the group was that we wouldn't be back, individually or as a whole.  I've been here before and enjoyed myself, but I really won't be back after yesterday's experience.

Really, yes really and he did! *BONUS POINTS*  Steve and his coworker were quick to get to cleaning, setting up wall guards to protect the corners and moving at lightning speed! I was amazed, 4 bedrooms and the hall were done in less than 2 hours. Believe me they needed a thorough cleaning, they did that and more. All of the carpets came out cleaner than before I moved in.

Let me preface this review by saying that my husband are, in no way, picky when it comes to hotels.  We've stayed in hostels, hotels, apartments, etc...we're more concerned about price and location than amenities.    However, The Quad is the one place I can honestly say I will never, ever, EVER stay again.  Upon check-in, I didn't think it was that bad - sure the carpet is old and kind of funky, and the room (we had one that was \"remodeled\") was pretty spartan, but we could handle it!  Since it was directly across the street from Caesar's Palace we were super pumped for our weekend in Vegas.  However, the first night while climbing into bed, I noticed that we didn't even have a fitted sheet on the bed.  It was just another top sheet that was folded under the mattress.  Okay - that's forgivable...it's kind of nasty but I can deal.   Then, the next morning I hop in the shower to get ready for the day.  Water pressure?  Hardly any.  It took a good 3 minutes just to rinse the shampoo out of my hair.  And THEN the water went ICE FRIGGIN COLD.  Never even went back to hot!  Just went from a nice warm temp to ice cubes for no reason.  I never did get any hot water again and my poor husband was forced to shower in freezing water.  This happened the next day as well....we were so upset!  Another gripe?  The elevator.  It was the slowest elevator I've ever been on.  Seriously, we waited around 5-10 minutes every single time just for the elevator to get on our floor.  When it finaly did arrive, there was such a huge line of people to get on that everyone stuffed themselves in there and then it was just a slow-moving sweatbox until you got to your desired floor.  The final straw, though, came as we checked out of the hotel.  We got in the cab and my husband turned to me and said he had a confession - on our first night he KILLED A FRIGGIN COCKROACH IN OUR ROOM.  He didn't want to tell me because I was so tired and he knew I wouldn't be able to sleep so he kept it to himself but he had to keep one eye open the entire time we spent at the hotel.   Just absolutely DISGUSTING.  I hate this place, I will never stay there again, and the management should just burn the entire thing down.  Whoever thinks it is acceptable to run a hotel like this is a complete moron.  No matter how much more it costs, PLEASE do yourself a favor and stay anywhere else.  I am seriously so easy going when it comes to lodging and this was just the nastiest place.","time_created":"2013-06-24 "}

We spent the weekend at the Staybridge and had a wonderful time. Our room had a full size fridge with ice machine, dishwasher, and a two element stove top, microwave, and all the basic pots, pans, utensils, glasses, wine and bottle openers etc .    Complimentary breakfast is offered daily. First day was bacon, scrambled eggs, various cereal, hard boiled eggs, variety of fresh fruit, French toast , yogurt, toast, bagel, milk, juices, oatmeal, make your own waffle station, hash browns, muffins, and toppings such as cheese, tomato, cucumber. There was also an  herbed flatbread topped with scrambled egg, cheese, bacon, and tomato.  Second day offered everything listed above in addition to sausages and and omelet filled with bacon, onion, peppers, cheese, and ham. A tea and coffee station is also available next to the dinning area. Overall, an pretty decent variety for a complimentary breakfast! There is little shop called \"the pantry\" which is open 24\/7 and sells various items like microwave dinners, pizza pops, chips, chocolate bars, snacks, and other items you may have forgotten at home.   This hotel also offers free laundry! There is a room with several machines so you can do your own laundry.   I didn't go into the fitness area but looking through the window it appeared to have the basics... Treadmills, exercise bike, weights etc. The pool had a waterslide and was never busy. We loved the pool and went everyday.   The hotel offers a complimentary \"social\" event Tuesday through Thursday evening 5pm-7pm. There is a complimentary light meal offered which changes each night for this event. There are complimentary board games and a guest book exchange in the lounge area.   What I didn't enjoy... The sofa bed! Or lord, the sofa bed!!! Do not, let me repeat, DO NOT plan on using the sofa bed. The mattress is extremely thin and spring filled. The springs dig into you and it feels like you're sleeping on a a rack of metal. The mattress also dips in at the center so you roll into the middle of the bed. We opted to share the double bed instead of having to utilize the sofa bed.   The hotel breakfast provides plastic utensils. On the first day we were offered regular plates, but on the second day styrofoam plates were provided.  This needs to change. Regular plates, utensils, and glasses should be offered. Styrofoam and plastic are horrible for the environment . If you have to provide and alternative please consider paper plates\/ glasses and regular utensils.   We would definitely stay here again!

Open front door and walk in.  Your sniffer will be attacked by the sweet smell of bacon, brats, kielbasa & other sausages.  If there is a crowd in the small interior, QUICK!! grab a number from the dispenser.  Make your choices -- like you're not likely to pick anything bad, even if you try.  My favorite is the red, white & blue brat, but hey!  You pick for yourself!  Don't be surprised if some of what you want is frozen solid, and they have to go back to the freezer to get it for you.  Don't be surprised if the staff act like they own the place -- some of them do, and that helps make them VERY knowledgeable!  Don't be surprised to find non-meat items for sale, to coordinate well with specials of the meat variety.  Never had a bad sausage from here -- some were gooder than others, y'know, but none bad.

The menu changes seasonally, so everything is always very fresh.  The price point is a little bit high, but not too bad for the quality you get.

It definitely lives up to its title.  I went here today for my 18th birthday and absolutely loved every bite. The menu is vast with many options, ranging from regular sushi to more extravagant teriyaki and even sushi pizza (although we didn't try this).  The fish was fresh and flavourful, each piece seemed to be cut and crafted with care. The chefs also add a large amount of fish, unlike most AYCE restaurants, which use too much rice to save on the cost of fish.  Service was good, but they seemed a bit understaffed. There were only two waitresses serving and bussing tables for about 25 people during the evening rush.  Make sure to place a reservation if you have a party of four or more! The restaurant is quite compact and the majority of the tables were filled with couples out for dinner. One group of 6 had to wait almost half an hour to get a seat.

I also really like the fact that whenever we come see a movie here, it's relatively slow (wait a minute, that could be a bad thing- ie. business being slow, uh-oh). It's a two floor theater with concession stands on both but the one that is open all the time (consistently) is the one on the main floor. Theaters 11-18 are on the second floor. The last few movies we've seen here have been on the second floor. This floor is very clean- never any trash lying around. Immediately following the end of the movie, the staff comes in to clean up any messes left by moviegoers- it's like clockwork. The last theater we went to had a strange huge amount of wasted space in the front (no seats)- don't know why, but worth mentioning, so if you happen to go into that particular theater, you were forewarned. There is a single bathroom that you will see first (handicap access?). The regular bathrooms (more stalls) are down a little further.","time_created":"2010-11-23 "}

So far my experience is negative. I knew exactly what I wanted though the cashier couldn't get it right. When he asked if I wanted mayo, mustard or Italian dressing I replied Italian. Then when he said \"so you want everything\". I repeated no that I did not want mustard or mayo. At this point the guy in line though he would jump in and educate me on how to order a sandwich. I have some angry words that I am holding back from my review about this guy. I told him I knew what I was doing and he continued to mettle. I told him to stop. I finalized my order and was trying to pay when the cashier instead turned to ask the guy behind me what he wanted because he assumed we were together!!! 30 minutes wait and my sndwich arrives. The bread was delicious and all was fresh. Not enough cheese though. The menu should list that the sandwich I ordered is comprised of the spicey hot meat. It was not as I expected. The bread was yummy.  Overall though I have had better thus the two star rating.","time_created":"2014-10-11 "}

To start, beautiful restaurant. The seats are comfortable, the ambiance is relaxing and fresh, and the service is impeccable. I started with a lovely tomato soup that came with a grilled toast place within the soup topped with goat cheese. Absolutely delicious. I had the halibut which came with a lovely couscous and orzo side that was absolutely delicious. The halibut was cooked perfectly and the size was perfect for lunch. I then had a zabaglione for dessert and it was really good, similar to strawberry shortcake in the best way. My friend started with a lovely salad and followed with a beautiful chicken breast with salad and summer vegetables. It too was incredibly good.  These were off of the power lunch menu, which we really liked. It allows you to have an appetizer followed by an entrée and dessert, and all are just the right size to have you full by the time you're done. The portions are generous without being overbearing. The dishes are absolutely beautiful when they come to your table. The glass of Prosecco was just the perfect amount of sweetness without being overbearing. The prices are reasonable, and once again, the service is bar none one of the best in town. This restaurant is an absolute must if you have never been here and a place people will go to over and over again if they have. 5+ rating.","time_created":"2017-04-08 "}

We were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday and three had of us emerged on to this cute little spot so conveniently located next to The Grind - but that's another review for another time.  I walked in, a few minutes after 3 p.m., to find my friends sipping on water and choosing their toe nail colors. I was welcomed by an employee and asked if I would like iced water or tea. Okay, pretty good start...  I am overtaken by all the boutique-y details and start to stroll the salon. It is super cute. And, as I look around, I become more comfortable with the services price list because it is obvious that they are going to build the value around the entire experience.  I sit down to have my pedicure and Katrina interjects naturally into the conversation that my friends and I are having as she starts the battle my snaggle-toes. I don't fight. My toes do, but I let her do what she needs to do. Katrina wins and I end up with short, even, well buffed, super shiny polished toes. They are gorgeous!   The experience was amazing.

Imagine a fusion of Polynesian-spam-based lunchroom, Korean kim chee joint and basic Chinese restaurant. Usually, when we hear \"Korean,\" it's some sort of Asian BBQ joint. Not this place. Upon sitting down, you will get a number of different pickle-type appetizers. We got two types of kim chee, kelp noodle in a mayonnaise sauce that was quite new and tasty, boiled peanuts, and bean sprouts in brine. We ordered the pan-fried dim sum and it was adequate. We ordered the fried chili shrimp and the meat-and-seafood stir fry.  The waiter warned us that the stir fry was the real deal, with sea cucumbers (sort of a cross between mushrooms and squid, but slimy). And indeed it had sea cucumbers, but nice enoki mushrooms too. I'm honestly not a huge fan of sea cucumbers but as the wait dude promised, they help make a nice gravy. Both dishes had a mix of fresh vegetables and that staple of Polynesian\/Chinese lunchrooms, mixed frozen vegetables of cut string beans, corn, cubed carrot and peas. I put that mix in canned chicken noodle soup to increase the nutrition content, but otherwise don't see much advantage to adding frozen mixed vegetables to real food.  Nothing to write home about; good solid food. I would be happy to try other items on the menu.","time_created":"2014-02-07 "}

I had been wanting to go for quite some time and finally got my wish.   The restaurant is very romantic and quaint. It has a very intimate feel and would be fabulous for an anniversary dinner or an evening out with a good friend. We wanted the true experience so we opted for four courses.   For our first course, we had The Movie Star which was calamari with slaw and asian love sauce. The calamari was crispy and delicious on its own but when combined with the slaw and sauce, it was fantastic.   The BLT wedge caught my eye so we decided to get it for our second course. It was definitely a wedge done very well. The overnight tomatoes were a great touch and the blue cheese was beyond delicious. There was a great deal of bacon on the salad which I really loved.   Everything on the menu sounded great so our choice of entree was very difficult. I chose the Mussels Normande in a cream sauce with bacon, mushrooms, and sherry. The portion was huge! The mussels were fresh and very good with the sauce. They portion of house made fries was also huge and delicious alone or when dipped in the  cream mussel bath! My friend ordered their gnocchi, which they are known for. The pasta was light and cooked to perfection. The accompanying ragout with Italian sausage was very flavorful. One would have a difficult time not licking their plate after consuming the pasta.   Although we were quite full, we had to order dessert. We decided to get the strawberry shortcake which was very light and a great way to end the meal. It was in the form of a layer cake and the strawberry preserves in the middle were fabulous.   I really enjoyed my experience at Lulu and was pleased the see that the prices were very reasonable. The portion sizes were also really big so you really feel like you are getting more bang for your buck. It would also be a really fun place to go and get small plates with a group of friends. I would definitely recommend Lulu because not only was the food amazing but the staff was very helpful and prompt.","time_created":"2010-07-09 "}

I've never dined in before but have ordered this through UberEats countless of times when I need a barbecue craving wolves but just don't want to get out my room.   The barbecue is just PHENOMENAL, along with their sides, it's just really tough to beat. Their cornbread is the right consistency of fluffy that I could just eat hella of it in one sitting.   Their potato salad is always good but I've only had better at my husband's cookouts when they decide to pull out the homemade batch. Their baked beans are also an awesome side for barbecue and I don't know, I'm just so in love with this place regarding comfort food.

Maybe it's because I haven't been to a Vegas buffet in a while, but I was impressed.  The food is constantly refreshed, and it's very clean.  Everything is separated into categories.  The food is labeled very clearly.  And they have many gluten free options which are also clearly labeled (a big relief to my wife).  Crab legs with the shells split and ready to eat.  Breakfast burritos with tomatillo salsa, eggs benny, carved meats, omelettes made to order, biscuits and gravy, a HUGE dessert selection of bite-sized beauties, and FREE BEER, WINE & MIMOSAS! If your idea of a good time is eating many courses of different foods over an extended period of time, you'll love it here.    The weak points are:   The mimosas are made with the cheapest sparkling wine possible (to be expected, I guess).   The wine I'm sure is of equal quality, but we didn't bother anyway. The salad bar is small and lacking in choices.  I'm probably the only who goes for salad at a $40 buffet, but there it is.","time_created":"2015-12-05 "}

(Hilarious by the way...) But, looks are deceiving that's for sure. I had never been to the Concord Mall and when you go over by the movie theater there is a mall entrance and a door that says separate entrance to the movie theater, or something along those lines. It's kind of a weird walk way into a tan door that leads into the mall by Forever 21 and the theater is to the right.   It was a nice looking place and we got right in with our tickets. We decided to get popcorn, and that right there is a major reason for the 5 rating... not the popcorn itself, but the butter. OMG. I told the kid behind the counter that I wanted popcorn with alot of butter, and he pointed me towards the end of the counter...\"The butter is at the end of the counter.\" WHATTTTTTT???? I get to pump my own butter? Do you realize I may die from clogged arteries right here in the walkway?? And that's exactly what it was like, they took the responsibility out of their own hands and said, \"here ya go movie patron, make yourself as fat as you'd like!\" UM OK!!!!   I of course drowned my small bag of popcorn with that delicious stream of warm butter and happily strolled into the theater to find my seat. The actual theater is your typical place, nicely done and decorated. I felt like the theater we were in was a bit small, but that could have been because of all the people. There wasn't an empty seat in the place. It's a bit of a drive from my house, so I'd probably not venture out there too often, but if it's by you, I'd give it a thumbs up.","time_created":"2012-06-26 "}

The service was non-existent.   I had called and spoken to the hostess regrading their hours. I was not told that there was an \"in between menu\" beginning at 2:30. I was told that they served lunch beginnig at 11:30 and that dinner started at 5. Please note the website says they open at 10:30am, so this is confusing.  I drove 300 miles from West Los Angeles and arrived around 3:45, an hour after they stopped serving lunch.The manager was kind enough to let us order a sandwiche off of the lunch menu, however. The \"in-between\" menu is severely limited, although I did order the burger off of that menu.  We were seated and ordered. This is when the rude, inconsiderate and bad service began. The man that delivered our food who I believe was a manager just put the plates down. He didn't say anything. He just brusquely placed them on the table. I ordered a burger and wanted condiments, but he scurried off before I could ask for mayo.   I had to flag down our server which took about five minutes. Meanwhile, my food was getting cold. One of my biggest pet peeves in restaurants is when I order a burger and then am not served condiments in a timely fashion.  Our server asked a busboy to bring mayo to the table. I swear that kid ran over to Whole Foods to buy a jar of Hellman's. It took several minutes to get the damn mayo!  Not once during the meal did our server come over to the table to see how everything was. We were not offered drink refills. He waited until we had cleared our plates and then came over and asked, \"Is everything okay?\"   We chided him for not paying attention to the table. He tried to make up for the bad service by bringing two tiny brownies over. Too little too late.  To Honey Salt's credit the food was great. My companion had the Cubano Sandwich wich was exquisite. I had the burger which was excellent. We both had espresso which was very good.  I am giving this place two rating because the service was non-existent. I don't mind paying $14 for a cheeseburger, but I want decent service to go with it.","time_created":"2014-07-28 "}

I've had better elsewhere, but its size and presentation made it seem extravagant. I did enjoy the assortment of waffle fries and regular fries that came on the side.  Fieri Family French Toast is a decent breakfast choice here. I felt the bacon didn't work too well with the French toast. Some establishments have excellent bacon and sweet pairings. They would candy the bacon and slice them into smaller bits. Then, the bacon would work harmoniously with other sweets as it introduces a unique subdued flavor. The French Toast here placed regular slices of large savory bacon on my toast and the flavors didn't work so well together. Of course the banana itself worked with the toast.

I am a light olive skin tone but have absolutely no base right now. Usually in custom tans I do a medium-dark spray and in Mystics I do a level 1 or 2. Never a 3! I said I wanted to get pretty dark for The Open so she suggested a level 3. I was a little hesitant but she assured me that would work or I could \"double-dip\" and get twice the amount of color. I erred on the side of caution and stayed with a basic level 3.   The spray process was so nice and the booth itself is really high tech and left me not feeling sticky or drippy (yay no streaks!) it's nice that the booth does a PH balance spray and the color solution is heated so it was a welcome surprise! I left with just a slightly bronze color and showered the next morning for maximum development.   I was really disappointed with the color. Nobody noticed I had gotten a spray tan. I didn't FEEL tan. It was almost like using a self tanning lotion like Jergens for a couple weeks. Very subtle but natural I suppose. I ended up getting a custom the next day from another place because it was THAT light.

The sandwich was tasty combination of veggies and the chicken was juicy and tender. The other items ordered was a fried chicken breast and french fries.

The portion size was large enough for two people although the small size was ordered.   The restaurant has a bright and comfortable feeling. Seating is choice of tables or booths. Orders are placed at the counter and the food is delivered to you. Except for the fountain sodas that are self serve. A server continuously makes the rounds checking your satisfaction and removing finished items.  There are many choices for chicken just like burgers.

When the food came, the portion were either so small for the price (24$ for 4 shrimps on some pasta main course but looking like an appetizer portion) or way too salty (three tiny oversalted skewers came - inedible). We wanted bread but we were told it's an extra 4$ \/portion and an extra 8 minute wait (we had already waited 1 hour). A friend who had asked to substitute one of the sides to couscous was brought an additional dish and blamed by the waitress for ordering it, although she had not clarified the substitution would actually be an additional dish and therefore be charged as an extra. When we complained about the quality of the food, the wait and everything else, the senior staff gave us a condescendant speech about Moroccan food and how the meat was salted for 30 days and that's the way it is (we were actually with a Moroccan who had never seen such small or salty portions in her life). They are definitely not open to feedback and at the cost of that tiny and over-salted meal, you can definitely get much better anywhere else in Montreal!","time_created":"2018-03-04 "}

I was a little disappointed that my sandwich was a lot smaller than the ones served at the Earl at Planet Hollywood across the street (I had the same sandwich late that night from this location). I felt like this Caesars location was a little skimpy on the meat as well as the vegetables. The Mac and Cheese was pretty good. Make sure you hold off on eating it quickly because it's super hot from the oven.   I noticed loaded baked potatoes on the menu at this location, which isn't available at the PH location. Potato lovers, eat your heart out!  Fountain drinks cost almost $5! Make sure you have an empty bladder to get enough refills!  If you have a Total Rewards players card you'll be able to get $1 off your sandwich. I unfortunately didn't have my card with me so I had to pay the extra dollar.

It was definitely worth the drive.  The first thing I noticed was the fact that there were not ads all over and busy clutter overwhelming your senses like regular grocery stores.  Sean M. hit it on the head, it is a lot like a small warehouse store.    They have all the usual staples your supermarket has, even cleaning and pet supplies.  BUT what makes this place special are the good quality food items at very reasonable prices.  The produce is prepackaged but it is all such good quality you won't be getting just one good tomato out of your pack of four.  They have berries, herbs, vegetables, prepackaged salads and their own dressings.  One warning about the prepackaged food, do not assume that this food is fresh and HEALTHY.  The few meals I picked up packed quite a fat and calorie punch.  I am not one to complain when fat is used for flavor, but just be aware that you are not necessarily getting low fat food here.  Speaking of which, I bought the truffle mousse that is made with chicken liver and duck fat and I seriously would consider spreading this on wood and eating it the stuff is so good. Its not even remotely good for you, but its DELICIOUS.    They have a lot of wine here that appears to be bottled or imported specifically for Fresh & Easy.  They also have a lot of varietals you don't see as much in your grocery store for really good prices.  I bought a bottle of Italian Primitivo for $5!  I haven't tried it yet but for $5 I couldn't pass it up.  The checkouts are self serve but the employees bag for you and also are right there to assist if you have any problems.  I don't know about you, but I played store when I was a kid, so the self checkout is kind of fun.  Buying alcohol slows you down as you have to have an employee come over for the age verification.  I give this 4 out of five rating because I think the self checkout is great for me, but not great for everyone.  There were some folks who were noticeably put off by the system.   Also, the beer selection is pretty bad.  They have a nice selection of wines but just your usual green bottles for imports and the crappy macro domestic garbage.

What a joy to find Deschamps a hop and skip as you exit PDA. Deschamps offers fancy fare without pretentiousness. The entire staff was witty, helpful and friendly. This place is a wine bar, so my friend was thrilled as he is quite a connaisseur. I'm a vegetarian, and the menu offered a wonderful selection of both vegetarian and meat appetizers and entrees. I had the soup of the day, a perfectly spiced lentil potage, with the goat cheese salad, which consisted of perfectly dressed fresh leafy greens and other finely cut vegetables, atop which rested two chèvre-stuffed philo bundles. I couldn't have been more satisfied. My friend was thrilled with his soup as well, followed by the duck confit with a side salad. I'm not a wine drinker, but I AM a coffee fanatic and Deschamps offered a PERFECT cup of coffee. In fact, although I did not indulge in dessert this time, I'm looking forward to returning for coffee and cheesecake.

So you start off with noodles or rice, then you choose your veggies (the sweet potato is incredible, try it) then on to your protein (beef, chicken, shrimp or tofu)-I've tried the chicken and the tofu, both super flavorful. Next you pick a sauce, I always go with the tamarind because I can't get enough tamarind and its a delicious sauce. They also have spicy sauces for those who enjoy spicy options. Then your pick some toppings-the pickled veggies are a must, the flavor is just perfect. Then it comes to around $10 so you're so pleased with the amount of food you just got. The bowls are pretty big! They also make sodas here which are really good! I've tried the mango ginger ale and it was pretty great.

Staff and Facilities = 4.5 rating Patrons = 1.5 rating  Don't let Saguaro tiny size discourage from stopping by.  The library is tiny, but packed to the brim with DVDs, CD's and books.  About a third of the space is devoted to media, another third for sitting  and a third for computers.    The movie selection and CD selection quite good, particularly for old movies like Alfred Hitchcock.  The magazine selection is kind of random, but the newspapers are always up to time_created.  There is generally a wait for the 15 computers, which can only be used for one hour.     There are plenty of staff to help you with few amenities of the library.  They are always more than helpful to assist a lost soul.  As for quiet study space, this is why this place is a 3.    I can honestly say, patrons here don't have a concept for library etiquette.  People regularly take cell phone calls and proceed to tell you their life story over the phone, while complaining about other's noise.   Study space is limited and definitely not tranquil.  So if you live within 1-2 mile radius of the library and need a quick movie or CD for the night, stop by, and please be courteous, the place is noise enough.","time_created":"2011-10-29 "}

Perfect blend of flavorful and spicy, the flour tortilla holds up to the filling but still melts in your mouth, and it's large enough for a meal. Sooooo good! I even catered a party for 40 people with them recently. There is no specific catering menu- I simply ordered a metric ton of tacos & quesadillas, gave them a few days notice, and paid in advance.

There were some gluten and dairy free options on the menu (phew) and I ordered the pollo tinga.  To make the pollo tinga gluten and dairy free, I had them omit some of the toppings.  Even without all of the toppings, I found my tacos to be quite yummy.  We also ordered the guacamole and chips. They were really good and I highly recommend them.  However, I'm not totally sure everything I ate was gluten free because I did experience some digestive issues during the meal.  Luckily, it was nothing too serious but I did feel really uncomfortable.  The good news is, my sister had a wonderful time!  She had a bunch or tacos and ordered the churros for dessert.  The churros are served in a chocolate pudding, which made the experience more memorable.  Our waiter was also really nice but the service was kind of slow.  I think the restaurant was understaffed.  This restaurant was packed and I don't believe they had one empty table.  The entire time we were there, I did not see our waiter take one break.  He was go-go-go!  Our waiter forgot to bring us condiments, beverages and cutlery when asked. On average, it would take about 30 minutes for any additional requests to be met.  His amazing personality helped ease the situation while some of us were waiting for things we needed to go with our meals.  The one thing I really did not like about this restaurant was they provided our table of 12 people with one bill.  That made paying quite difficult at the end of the night because everyone ordered tons of tapas, drinks and it was hard to figure out how much each person owed.  It would have been much easier to have separate bills or the bill divided by seat.

My friend and I headed out for brunch the day before my birthday.  We knew we didn't want to wait in line somewhere, but we wanted something a litte more glamorous than a donut and a double double - afterall, I AM turning 30 again.  It's dead when we arrive and the restaurant is freezing but our server brings us our coffees quickly...along with ice cold milk and a single packet of sugar.  I don't know about you, but I really enjoy my coffee, I like to savour the creamy richness of it, and pouring ice cold 1% in a good cup of coffee is like eating turkey bacon - it might sound like a good idea, but it's obviously a poor imposter for the real thing.  Our server raves about the french toast and sugary carbs seem like the responsible thing to do since we're both drinking diet coffee.  Our meal arrives and it's gorgeous - 5 pieces of french baguette stacked up in a french toast tower, fruit on each piece and pre-syruped.  Wait a second...pre-syruped?  Well maybe that's just to keep the whole tower together....  We dive in and it's immediately apparent that the Brasserie do not understand my syrup needs.  No worries, our server helpfully brings me another teaspoon of syrup.  My friend is less concerned with syrup, and more concerned with the fact that her knife is unable to slice through the crust-heavy nature of the french toast.  I'm having similar difficulties, what the hell is this crust made of?  We both just pick up a piece with our hands and attempt to eat it that way.  I'll admit it, we should have told the server that the french toast was awful.  Though, our quality check was late because she was drinking wine behind the bar and maybe didn't notice us playing Jenga with our food.  We left hungry and unsatisfied, walked down the street to Crave, got our damn sugary carbs and picked up a hot coffee and felt much better.  The cupcakes helped our mood immensely.  I'm going to chalk this up to ordering the wrong thing but I'm not eager to go back.

It was a terrible experience and ruined my vacation. My vacation that I paid TONS of money for. We were in Vegas for Memorial Day weekend on a whim as I really just needed to relax. This trip was beyond stressful thanks to these horrible people.  A guy (I think his name was Austin) in a booth in front of our hotel (TI) waved us over, asked if we were married (odd - but we are not) and offered us free show tix, etc - we were told we'd be getting a tour of a new resort for the purpose of word of mouth advertising. Had no idea this was a timeshare presentation.  1. They kept us waiting for over an hour in the lobby - I asked whether this hour+ wait time was included in the 2-3 hours we were told we would have to be here in order to receive our \"free\" gifts. NOPE! Should have demanded a refund and ride back to TI at this point, but we were already there (if you want an upgraded package you pay a bit and are promised tons more stuff)... 2. They had told us not to eat beforehand as we would be fed lunch as part of the tour. By the time we got there my bf was beyond starving. Buffet at the Silverton was definitely subpar. 3. Way far away from the strip. Why did I agree to buy this bs again? 4. Pushy Pushy Pushy! High Pressure. It was hell.  5. Lots of old people here. Didn't seem very fun to make up for the distance from the strip. Reminded me of a retirement home. 6. We were there for a total of 8 hours. On Saturday. After a long drive the night before. After being told 2-3 hours. Ended up extending our hotel stay (which was super expensive) just to try to salvage our trip after this. 7. They pretty much would not let us leave as long as we kept resisting their sales pitches. Why I caved, I will never be able to reconcile with myself... 8. We had a driver take us back to the hotel at 8pm (on them luckily) as the shuttles had stopped running. I had instant buyer's remorse and vocalized this in the car. THANK GOD for this driver, I'd go back and tip her more if I could - she goes, well, I believe that by law you have 72 hours or something to get out of that. Upon getting back to the room and researching it - YES! You have 5 DAYS according to NV law. There is a cancellation form contained within the contract as well. Hallelujah! 9. We agreed to a price of I think 11k + 175\/year maintenance fees. We found people selling these things on ebay for 2-3k. Yep, definitely cancelling!  Got my refund for the deposit today - thank goodness it wasn't even MORE of a pain.  You people should be ashamed!  Just remember - YOU HAVE 5 DAYS TO BAIL!","time_created":"2014-06-12 "}

This could t be any more applicable. The food speaks for itself. It's good, quality meat, grilled\/smoked to absolute, melt in your mouth, perfection. As I patiently waited in line, already drooling over the perfectly fatty brisket before me, the man carving the meat who I could only presume is the owner, sliced me a piece to sample. It was sublime. I decided on the El Jefe which included the aforementioned brisket as well as sausage, pickles, onions, and coleslaw. It comes with one side, but seeing that I couldn't decide between beans or jalapeño grits, I sprung for both (an incredibly wise decision). Halfway through my meal, the owner checked up on me and asked what I thought. I was speechless. Not only because the food was nothing short of phenomenal, but also because I had a huge bite of my sandwich in my mouth. I stupidly responded with a nod and thumbs up. Do yourself a favor, come here and treat yourself to some good bbq.

It was around 2 pm and there were only two tables occupied in the joint.  A lady behind the counter asked if I was dining in or out.  When I told her I was dining in, she handed me a menu and told me I could sit anywhere in the restaurant.  After browsing the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the Italian Sub (Ham, Capricole, Genoa Salami, Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and Provolone Cheese) $10.50....came with Fries, Cole Slaw, and Pickle.  I also ordered a side of Jalapenos, in case I wanted to add some kick to it.  While I waited for my food, I looked around the joint.  There are beverage coolers in the front of the Deli that had Sodas & Bottled Water.  I was tempted to buy a bottle of Dr. Browns Natural Soda, but after reading the label I decided against it because it said \"Sugar\/High Fructose Corn Syrup\".....how is that \"natural\"?  I'm trying to avoid HFCS, so I passed and got a bottle of Water.  They also have Bagels & Pastries available for purchase.....they looked tempting (see pics), but I wanted to wait until after I had my Sandwich to decide if I would do Dessert.  After a few minutes my Sandwich came out.  The thing was piled high with Meat!  (see pics) I wasn't expecting this....I had to remove some of it before I ate the Sandwich, just so I could take a bite.  After a few bites, I realized that it was a pretty dry Sandwich.....so I asked for Mayo & Mustard.  I added a little of both and it still lacked something....so I took the Cole Slaw and put it in the Sandwich....ahh, much better!  The Sandwich by itself was too dry and lacked the flavor of really good Italian Sandwiches....at least to me.  The Fries were pre-fab Crinkle Fries.....pretty bland, had to add Salt.  They weren't that good.  The Cole Slaw very excellent, not too runny or sweet and had a nice crunch to it, which I like.  The Pickle was eh....I've had better.  Overall, it was a OK experience.

It is extremely overpriced and an awful place to live. At one point, the maintenece workers were fixing something in the apartment below me and for some reason needed to get into my apartment to access something. Now, I work night shifts and sleep during the day. Its usually pretty noisy around here so I wear ear plugs. They had apparently knocked on my door for a while and when I didn't answer they decided to let themselves in. As they did not have my permission this is illegal. So they walk in and notice me sleeping (NAKED but under covers, but still very very awkward) in my bed. So they shout to wake me up. \"Hey is it OK if we come in here to fix something? The front office said you were called and you gave us permission.\" I never received ANY phone call and I never gave ANYONE permission to enter. They immediately told this blatant lie to cover up their illegal entry. I let them work on whatever it was they needed to do anyway. When I contacted the office they played stupid.  They changed the resident payment portal without telling anyone and when I asked about payment methods they stared at me like I was stupid. They lost one of my packages with no apology and blamed it on the postal service. They have now ripped out most of the grass areas and replaced them with ugly gravel and installed fake grass out front (ew). Now they are redoing the pavement throughout the complex which I don't think is very necessary... I would much rather them install more covered parking since right now it is \"first come first serve\" and there are probably 3 resident cars to each covered spot. It is a daily fight to find a covered spot and most good spots are taken up by abandoned cars. The office staff is rude. There are ALWAYS landscapers outside with noisy equipment which really sucks since I work nights and sleep during the day. Maintenance does not respond quickly (or at all) and rarely fixes the actual issue. Sounds travel so easily through the floor and walls. I have had clothing stolen out of the communal laundry room.

Their scheduling and billing are terrible at best.   Got a referral to Valley ENT from my doctor after going to another ENT Doctor who only knew the word \"surgery\" for a deviated septum when I complained of allergies. Turns out going here they never even suggested surgery instead did allergy testing and gave me a prescription decongestant spray and put me on immunotherapy drops. The results were outstanding!!!  Being on time and billing though are catastrophic.   Usually, you wait 15-30 minutes beyond your scheduled time to see the doctor. But on the most important visit, the one where they give you your results and talk about treatment plan the practitioner was 1 hour and 20 minutes late. Unfortunately, I had another immovable appointment I had to get to. As I was walking out I ran into her and she told me she would make it quick. So we ran through everything and she suggested I do the immunotherapy. I agreed. I called in that Friday to place my order and they told me that the Practioner needed to see me again because she didn't have enough time to go through everything when I was in.   Of course it took two weeks to get another appointment, and of course they charged me for it.   That leaves me with my billing complaints. Demand that they tell you the cost upfront - if you don't good luck.   I have been there 4 times. Each time I paid a large sum (over $200) for the previous visit. Yet, I still get a bill after the insurance adjustment and their bills do not make sense.   For instance.   $600 bill $278 adjustment for insurance $341 payment Balance of $312.96  If you understand math you can see that on my $600 bill they collect over $900  I pointed this out and they insist the amount charged is actually the amount AFTER my payment (yeah right) and then the insurance and then I pay the balance.   For anyone in accounting is this GAAP? Heck no it isn't. This is IRS puts you in the pokey kind  of accounting.   This place is in desperate need of a COO and a CFO.   The doctors and practitioners are great, very knowledgeable, the staff is friendly and apologetic but the operational processes of this place prove that doctors are not taught basic organizational management and thankfully the highest number of body parts doctors have to count to are 10 fingers and 10 toes. And at this office, it is fortunate you have only 2 ears, 1 nose, and 1 throat because anything over that would stretch their intellectual ability.

Service was like they were either ignoring us or being chased by something with the speed they came to the table and then took off again.  Where they lost all kinds of rating was with my coffee.  I told them decaf - several times - but when they gave me my cup and I tasted it it was not decaf.  I can tell the difference; I have to know the difference.  So when we finally got someone to come back to our table we said this wasn't decaf give us decaf.  Guy comes back with a carafe that was NOT marked decaf.  He swore it was and then walked off with it and poured another table some coffee.  Had to get another person to take that cup away and give me the real decaf.

It was easy to get a consultation appointment and the front desk staff is always cheerful and helpful. The location was easy to find with ample parking. My consultation was great and the insurance coordinator worked with my father to ensure that my procedure would be correctly filed with a new insurance policy. Even during a typically busy week (college spring break) I was able to schedule my surgery quite easily within my stringent schedule.  I was given four prescriptions - nausea pill, two types of pain management (one for morning of surgery) and an antibiotic.   The morning of the surgery I was welcomed by Dr. Bond's warm candor and put under general anesthesia which made the procedure go by instantly. I woke up and had hardly any bleeding, no pain, and I wasn't drugged up \" a la\" the infamous youtube videos you see these days. The staff explained the next steps to my father and off I went to recover.   Recovery was simple and I had absolutely no side-effects. No nausea, no chipmunk cheeks, no swelling or bruising. It was honestly as close to a perfect recovery as possible and I attribute that to Dr. Bond's talent and finesse with his craft.   Post op appointment was again, easily scheduled, and I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. I am thrilled to have found the practice of Dr. Bond and if I ever need another procedure done in his specialty I know who I'll be using!","time_created":"2014-03-15 "}

He even told us that surgery doesn't necessarily work, and that he didn't feel comfortable recommending it off the bat! He was also able to give our hissing, uncomfortable, finicky cat her medicine anti inflammatory shot in less than 4 seconds!!!!!  On top of that, we had a lot in common with him. From being healthy, vegan, into music and vinyl, a family man, loves animals, a cyclist and knows mutual people that we consider wonderful!

On super fun occasions, there will be cute boys playing cheesy songs and singing along to the jukebox. But only on special occasions.    Unpretentious but cool does say it best.","time_created":"2009-03-02 "}

I booked the Hilton Toronto on Hotwire and it was seriously awesome. Coming in at just over $90 after taxes and fees, or about half the going rate, it was an awesome value.  Right downtown, the location was super convenient, just a few blocks from Union Station, Queen St., and right next to a subway stop. I got a room on the 29th floor and the views are great as well. I literally spent the first fifteen minutes in my room just staring out and peoplewatching.  The rest of the hotel isn't anything amazing or stand-out -- it's no boutique hotel -- but service was quick, friendly, and efficient.  My colleague also booked through Hotwire but was able to double-dip and use his HHonors membership to get a room on the executive (31st) floor, lounge access, and points towards his account. The lounge is pretty sweet and I'd say lives up to the other reviews.  Finally, WiFi was free for me, but I'm not sure if that's a result of being up on the higher floors or if that's hotel-wide.

This is not the type of place I would normally frequent.  I'd seen this place, up on the hill, as I drove past on the beltline a million times.  So what made me finally come here?  My instructor was belly dancing on the restaurant side one Friday night and I wanted to support her.  Why do I return?  This place feels like home now and I want to support the great people at Hookah, restaurant and bar side.  And for the karaoke!  Belly dancing is featured Friday and Saturday nights in the restaurant side.  They have tables and booths where you can eat dinner while watching the featured dancer.  The menu is a mix of Mediterranean and American dishes, mostly small plates and sharables.  I think the shimp flatbread is my favorite.  My friend raves about the baba ganoush.  Although there are several vegetarian options there's little on the menu for gluten-sensitive folks unless you eat meat without bread, skip the pita served with the hummus and baba ganoush, etc.  But if you're gluten sensitive I'm sure you know all these tricks.  If gluten doesn't bother you the pistachio cake is AMAZING.    They also have a bar and an area with leather couches on the restaurant side if you prefer to relax and sip a beverage or smoke a hookah.  Drink specials include Old Fashioned on Friday and Bacardi or Captain mixers on Saturday.  The have several delicious specialty martinis as well.  After dinner and the show head on over to the karaoke bar side.  If Billy's behind the bar say \"hi\" from me.  He's always got a smile on his face.  You can't help but smile back.  They are working on updating the karaoke selection but most of the crowd tend toward the tried-and-true favorites anyway.  I've found certain DJs are more friendly and interactive than others but they all do a great job of getting new singers into the rotation.  Smaller tables dot the space, plus plenty of bar stools and even a few leather couches and chairs for relaxing between songs.  Grab a drink, smoke a hookah, and enjoy the singers.  A word of warning in the restroom, the stall doors don't quite lock.  But they've always been clean and well stocked when I've been there.  The one time they were running low on TP I let one of the bartenders know and a new roll arrived pronto!  Parking is decent, located around the building.

Lots of lobster and kinda scant on the spinach, oddly. My husband had the pesto which was classic and well done.

You need to do what Dr Waltz suggests, but it will 100% be worth the effort. Went from 10 years + of chronic pain, to (at week 4) being able to wake up and move around again without being worried about managing my pain.     ____________________________ My Reasons For Going: 10 + years of severe Chronic lower back pain. Couldn't walk talk sleep eat or breathe without being in moderate to severe pain. My entire life was dictated by how bad the pain was that day.  Found a Groupon with a great deal.  ____________________________ Pros: - The 1st chiropractor that has truly helped me. - Doesn't want me to be a long-term patient. (Most chiros want you to go come 1 or 2 x,s a week forever. Just whenever you need it) - Starts with Xrays and wants to do them again in 4-8 weeks again to prove what he is doing works.   Cons: - None to speak of that I can think of. Really a great overall experience.  - Plan for your first few visits to take some extra time, because Dr. Waltz is getting to know how your body responds to the treatment, as well as he wants to make sure you're comfortable throughout the process. _____________________________________  What to expect when you're getting started    1. The first visit (consultation) took an hour. (X-rays and exams). Hour-ish for two people. (My wife and I are both going together)  2. The second visit we reviewed Xrays and got our first adjustment. Hour-ish as well. Dr. Waltz explain the Xrays in detail so we both felt 100% comfortable with the process. We were even given copies of the Xrays for our personal records. ____________________________  First Week: 5\/8\/17 3 adjustments.  Tues Weds and Thursday.   For the first time,  I am seeing hope for my back pain and it has only been a week.  My back used to crack and pop every time I moved. My lower back was in piercing pain.  5\/15\/2017 Week 2: 3 adjustments again this week.   For the first time, my muscles around my trouble spots are actually relaxing. I am feeling a relief from pain already, which is a massive feat.  My pain has switched from joint pain to muscle pain.   I am beyond excited to finally have a solution to my chronic severe back pain. I can't believe it was this easy. Honestly came down to going to the right chiropractor. This is my 5th doctor I've worked with, and it is the first time it has actually worked.   More Uptime_createds to come. Really hopeful now for the first time in over 10 years.  5\/22 Week 3: 2 Adjustments this week.  Started doing stretches and workouts at home this week.  This was the week of muscle soreness, which is a great change from joint\/spine pain.  Had a few times this week where I woke up without any pain.   Pain is now manageable. No longer taking pain medicine all day. Keeping the ice-pack close to keep down joint\/muscle swelling as my body adjusts to the new alignment.  5\/29\/17 Week 4: 2 Adjustments this week.  Doing more workouts and stretches this week. Muscles are still sore, but the workouts are easier now. Still some joint\/back pain but it's only been 4 weeks.  At this point, my body is just tense and tight, so doing more stretches and keeping up with the workout this week.  Still not needing pain meds any longer. Ice pack still close by. I find that when I start to feel tight, I put on the ice-pack and it prevents the pain from getting worse.   6\/5\/17 Week 5: 2 Adjustments this week.  Waking up without being in any pain this week 3 days now. Starting more aggressive stretching and workouts. The muscles are the biggest obstacle at this point. Minor joint pain still in my trouble spots.   No pain meds. Minimal ice pack. Still icing at night when I get into bed and right after adjustments to keep swelling down.","time_created":"2017-05-13 "}

I've eaten here a few times now and I have to say the flavored pack a punch.  When being served for the first time I felt this deja vu... What type of wrap would I like? White or whole wheat... What meat would like? Chicken, beaf, shredded beaf, vegetarian or we'll go check it out to find out what else.. Then choose ur rice, I love the Mexican rice. Choose ur beans ? Black beans for me, they are apparently spicier. Add your vegetables that are nicely sautéed and fresh. Finally pick ur sauce... Ok this is where u need to take a step back..  There are endless choices.. And if that wasn't enough there are additional ones on the table! ... It's like being at subway but what Taco Bell couldn't master this place did.  I did enjoy the burrito with shredded beaf! (You can mix both beefs of u like), I took a small and I was stuffed! The hot sauce is fantastic!  I've been there during a work lunch hour, the line was long but what do you expect in Ville Saint Laurent and surrounded by businesses. I did find the line moved at a reasonable speed. I'm impressed that there were 8 staff active behind the counter!!! That more then the amount of construction workers actually working on Decarie express ;)  I hope it's profitable to keep this many staff. The seating is not bad, lots of space and found electrical plugs all over so taking ur laptop or charge ur phone not a problem.  There are TV's which is another plus.  I you find it noisy then take ur food to go and find a quiet place.  The one issue I did have was take out.  I ordered the quesadillas to go. When I took them out after 15min they were all one big mush! The heat and the sauce turned the wrap into a floppy, sticky and unpleasant meal. The to go needs to be worked on. Wrapping a burrito in only foil when it's hot will only trap the moister and turn it into mush.  Overall a great place to try if u happen to be in Ville Saint Laurent..","time_created":"2015-10-17 "}

We were raised to respect our elders!!! More than I can say for some people.   We heard about this tour from my bf's parents and how excruciating the tour was for them.  They were not pleased from all pushy sales people.  In sales world a single \"no\" is not enough, but when said multiple times I'm sure that no becomes definite.  The parents were incredibly irritated and agreed that it put a damper to their mini vacay. I understand it is sales, but taking the aggressive route aggravates guests.

We hated the high-pressure sales antics at car dealerships so it was comforting stepping into Markham Subaru where everyone was laid back and no one was hyper to get the next sale. We dealt directly with Carlo who appeared to be the owner.  The dealership was sold out of some models, so Carlo checked his province-wide listing and pointed us to other dealerships which possessed those vehicles, even though it meant sacrificing a sale.  Once we decided on a vehicle, Carlo gave us a no-haggle price which was firm. Everything he did was up-front and transparent.  We ended up purchasing our car from Carlo, primarily because of his rigid integrity. However, upon delivery of the vehicle, we were disappointed that some details did not turn out as we ordered. There was also a scratch on the door vinyl and a stain on the sunroof upholstery. Carlo offered to replace the scratched paneling, but we have to live with the sunroof stain because of the enormous work needed to replace that part.  From the opened garage area door, I also had a chance to watch the dealership's detailing guy (named Francis) working on various cars and was impressed with his passion for detailing. Without doubt, Francis is a true perfectionist.   Despite the disappointment we experienced, I'd have to rate Markham Subaru five rating. It was pleasant dealing with people who are downright honest and go the extra mile to be caring.  If our next car is also a Subaru, we won't go anywhere except Markham Subaru. We would have saved ourselves a huge amount of time and travel expense by dealing with Carlo right from the beginning.","time_created":"2017-10-25 "}

I was not happy with how they handle their business and would never dine here again. I also overheard a woman in the restaurant commenting on the baked goods have absolutely no flavor.  Thankfully I found another wonderful place for brunch close by I would avoid this stinker","time_created":"2015-12-06 "}

First: The service... Whether it's Jamie who meets and greets you at the door, or Devin or Krista or any of the other lovely people that work there to take care of you, everyone is on point!   Second: The beer... The selection is incredible! They've got something for everyone... Even if you don't drink beer, there's a beer for you. I love beer, but there is this one that they carry, Redline Leather Interior Vanilla Almond Brown Ale... Can't find it anywhere else and it makes me lose my $#!+ when I see it on the rotating menu... Definitely worth checking out!  Third: THE FOOD!! Do yourself a favor and get the Venison Tartare. You'll be really glad you did!!!!  Fourth: The value! You get a lot without having to pay a lot. Food portions are great and you can drink craft beer without paying insane craft beer prices!   Check this place out and have a great time! You may have to wait depending on when you go... But it's totally worth it!","time_created":"2016-03-18 "}

We bought a brand new Jeep Cherokee Sport - after few hours of having it at home we realized that the driver's door was not locking . We contacted and took the car back to this dealership....they had to order new parts for A NEW CAR !They called us in less than week later that the part is in for us to come in -we had to wait for their shuttle and basically took a full day ...we came to p\/u and they told us that actually only 1 out of 2 parts came in so we have to do this again in a week or two! Every time we went there they had problems finding the car key under our name (we later found out that the car was still registered under their dealership).   We had to go to this dealership 10 x and numberous phone calls, emails and extreme stress .... every time we got there to p\/u our \"fixed\" new car -something else was wrong with it (cabin lights were not working, gas tank was not opening etc).  Finally they said that it is all done (after over 1 month going back and forth)we got there only to find out that the car was back to square one-with the same problem we dropped the car off with !!!  They were clearly struggling fixing this faulty car and chose not to give us a refund or to give us another car -as this car was still under their dealership name and was not registered under ours yet. This time they kept the car for full 3 weeks ! We finally got Our BRAND New car - which needed a number of new parts ordered and help from the Chrysler's technician . Fianlly after almost 7 weeks we received our Brand new-fixed car!  The magament and the owner are not professional AT ALL ! They are so fake -they just want to sell you a car -pretending that you are \"like their  family\". I would never ever reffer anyone to this dealership...they are wasting everyone's time !  This is our 2nd new car we bought here -we had no real issue with the 1st car so never had to deal with the management only with the mechanics- but this time it was the Worst experience to deal with the owner and the management at this dealeship.There is ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ! No emails responses from the management-the have NO manners and no idea how to deal with clients. Owner is the worse we ever had to deal with !","time_created":"2018-01-21 "}

I keep updating it because the experience changes from month to month (I eat there about 6-7 times a month). I noticed that staff is a lot friendlier than in the  past. The food is still good and I believe they dropped the prices on some of their juices (but don't quote me on that).  I recommend the magic tofu wrap, the chopped caesar,  any of their soups, the middle eastern plate, mega protein salad, and grilled veggie + pesto burrito - oh and if you get the powehouse bowl - get it with their spicy peanut sauce instead of tahini. For juices, i recommend the strawberry fields with their wheat grass replacement (just as healthy without the nasty wheatgrass taste) and the liver flush (warning: this has a strong flavour from the ginger and citrus, but worth it if you plan on doing a lot of drinking).   FRESH gets 3 rating just because I've had issues in the past with unfriendly staff and a few times my sweet potato fries and tempeh have been brought to the table when they wer'e clearly burned. This hasn't happened in the last year though.","time_created":"2011-01-10 "}

He had a wellness exam there about 7 months ago and is perfectly healthy. I really don't want to spend an extra $40.  I can take him to the Petsmart clinic or humane society clinic and get the shot minus the wellness exam, and my vet said \"fine\"!!!! After many years and $100's of dollars spent there, I was surprised and disappointed  that he wouldn't let me take him there and just pay him for a rabies shot, after all he'd be going back in in a couple of months for his other shots and ANOTHER wellness exam!!!!! I wll be leaving this clinic after almost 5 years. I thought a relationship with the vet was valualble but not to me just to him.
